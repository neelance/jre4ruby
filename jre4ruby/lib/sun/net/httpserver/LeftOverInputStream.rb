  # a (filter) input stream which can tell us if bytes are "left over"
  # on the underlying stream which can be read (without blocking)
  # on another instance of this class.
  # 
  # The class can also report if all bytes "expected" to be read
  # were read, by the time close() was called. In that case,
  # bytes may be drained to consume them (by calling drain() ).
  # 
  # isEOF() returns true, when all expected bytes have been read
