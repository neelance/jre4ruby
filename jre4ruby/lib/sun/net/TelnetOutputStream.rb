  # This class provides input and output streams for telnet clients.
  # This class overrides write to do CRLF processing as specified in
  # RFC 854. The class assumes it is running on a system where lines
  # are terminated with a single newline <LF> character.
  # 
  # This is the relevant section of RFC 824 regarding CRLF processing:
  # 
  # <pre>
  # The sequence "CR LF", as defined, will cause the NVT to be
  # positioned at the left margin of the next print line (as would,
  # for example, the sequence "LF CR").  However, many systems and
  # terminals do not treat CR and LF independently, and will have to
  # go to some effort to simulate their effect.  (For example, some
  # terminals do not have a CR independent of the LF, but on such
  # terminals it may be possible to simulate a CR by backspacing.)
  # Therefore, the sequence "CR LF" must be treated as a single "new
  # line" character and used whenever their combined action is
  # intended; the sequence "CR NUL" must be used where a carriage
  # return alone is actually desired; and the CR character must be
  # avoided in other contexts.  This rule gives assurance to systems
  # which must decide whether to perform a "new line" function or a
  # multiple-backspace that the TELNET stream contains a character
  # following a CR that will allow a rational decision.
  # 
  # Note that "CR LF" or "CR NUL" is required in both directions
  # (in the default ASCII mode), to preserve the symmetry of the
  # NVT model.  Even though it may be known in some situations
  # (e.g., with remote echo and suppress go ahead options in
  # effect) that characters are not being sent to an actual
  # printer, nonetheless, for the sake of consistency, the protocol
  # requires that a NUL be inserted following a CR not followed by
  # a LF in the data stream.  The converse of this is that a NUL
  # received in the data stream after a CR (in the absence of
  # options negotiations which explicitly specify otherwise) should
  # be stripped out prior to applying the NVT to local character
  # set mapping.
  # </pre>
