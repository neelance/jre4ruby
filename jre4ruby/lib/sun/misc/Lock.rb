  # The Lock class provides a simple, useful interface to a lock.
  # Unlike monitors which synchronize access to an object, locks
  # synchronize access to an arbitrary set of resources (objects,
  # methods, variables, etc.). <p>
  # 
  # The programmer using locks must be responsible for clearly defining
  # the semantics of their use and should handle deadlock avoidance in
  # the face of exceptions. <p>
  # 
  # For example, if you want to protect a set of method invocations with
  # a lock, and one of the methods may throw an exception, you must be
  # prepared to release the lock similarly to the following example:
  # <pre>
  # class SomeClass {
  # Lock myLock = new Lock();
  # 
  # void someMethod() {
  # myLock.lock();
  # try {
  # StartOperation();
  # ContinueOperation();
  # EndOperation();
  # } finally {
  # myLock.unlock();
  # }
  # }
  # }
  # </pre>
