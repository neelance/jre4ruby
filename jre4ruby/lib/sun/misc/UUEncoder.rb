  # This class implements a Berkeley uu character encoder. This encoder
  # was made famous by uuencode program.
  # 
  # The basic character coding is algorithmic, taking 6 bits of binary
  # data and adding it to an ASCII ' ' (space) character. This converts
  # these six bits into a printable representation. Note that it depends
  # on the ASCII character encoding standard for english. Groups of three
  # bytes are converted into 4 characters by treating the three bytes
  # a four 6 bit groups, group 1 is byte 1's most significant six bits,
  # group 2 is byte 1's least significant two bits plus byte 2's four
  # most significant bits. etc.
  # 
  # In this encoding, the buffer prefix is:
  # <pre>
  # begin [mode] [filename]
  # </pre>
  # 
  # This is followed by one or more lines of the form:
  # <pre>
  # (len)(data)(data)(data) ...
  # </pre>
  # where (len) is the number of bytes on this line. Note that groupings
  # are always four characters, even if length is not a multiple of three
  # bytes. When less than three characters are encoded, the values of the
  # last remaining bytes is undefined and should be ignored.
  # 
  # The last line of data in a uuencoded file is represented by a single
  # space character. This is translated by the decoding engine to a line
  # length of zero. This is immediately followed by a line which contains
  # the word 'end[newline]'
