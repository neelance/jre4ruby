  # MetaIndex is intended to decrease startup time (in particular cold
  # start, when files are not yet in the disk cache) by providing a
  # quick reject mechanism for probes into jar files. The on-disk
  # representation of the meta-index is a flat text file with per-jar
  # entries indicating (generally speaking) prefixes of package names
  # contained in the jar. As an example, here is an edited excerpt of
  # the meta-index generated for jre/lib in the current build:
  # 
  # <PRE>
  # % VERSION 1
  # # charsets.jar
  # sun/
  # # jce.jar
  # javax/
  # ! jsse.jar
  # sun/
  # com/sun/net/
  # javax/
  # com/sun/security/
  # @ resources.jar
  # com/sun/xml/
  # com/sun/rowset/
  # com/sun/org/
  # sun/
  # com/sun/imageio/
  # javax/
  # com/sun/java/swing/
  # META-INF/services/
  # com/sun/java/util/jar/pack/
  # com/sun/corba/
  # com/sun/jndi/
  # ! rt.jar
  # org/w3c/
  # com/sun/imageio/
  # javax/
  # sunw/util/
  # java/
  # sun/
  # ...
  # </PRE>
  # <p> A few notes about the design of the meta-index:
  # 
  # <UL>
  # 
  # <LI> It contains entries for multiple jar files. This is
  # intentional, to reduce the number of disk accesses that need to be
  # performed during startup.
  # 
  # <LI> It is only intended to act as a fast reject mechanism to
  # prevent application and other classes from forcing all jar files on
  # the boot and extension class paths to be opened. It is not intended
  # as a precise index of the contents of the jar.
  # 
  # <LI> It should be as small as possible to reduce the amount of time
  # required to parse it during startup. For example, adding on the
  # secondary package element to java/ and javax/ packages
  # ("javax/swing/", for example) causes the meta-index to grow
  # significantly. This is why substrings of the packages have been
  # chosen as the principal contents.
  # 
  # <LI> It is versioned, and optional, to prevent strong dependencies
  # between the JVM and JDK. It is also potentially applicable to more
  # than just the boot and extension class paths.
  # 
  # <LI> Precisely speaking, it plays different role in JVM and J2SE
  # side.  On the JVM side, meta-index file is used to speed up locating the
  # class files only while on the J2SE side, meta-index file is used to speed
  # up the resources file & class file.
  # To help the JVM and J2SE code to better utilize the information in meta-index
  # file, we mark the jar file differently. Here is the current rule we use.
  # For jar file containing only class file, we put '!' before the jar file name;
  # for jar file containing only resources file, we put '@' before the jar file name;
  # for jar file containing both resources and class file, we put '#' before the
  # jar name.
  # Notice the fact that every jar file contains at least the manifest file, so when
  # we say "jar file containing only class file", we don't include that file.
  # 
  # </UL>
  # 
  # <p> To avoid changing the behavior of the current application
  # loader and other loaders, the current MetaIndex implementation in
  # the JDK requires that the directory containing the meta-index be
  # registered with the MetaIndex class before construction of the
  # associated URLClassPath. This prevents the need for automatic
  # searching for the meta-index in the URLClassPath code and potential
  # changes in behavior for non-core ClassLoaders.
  # 
  # This class depends on make/tools/MetaIndex/BuildMetaIndex.java and
  # is used principally by sun.misc.URLClassPath.
