  # Implementation of an SSL socket factory.  This provides the public
  # hooks to create SSL sockets, using a "high level" programming
  # interface which encapsulates system security policy defaults rather than
  # offering application flexibility.  In particular, it uses a configurable
  # authentication context (and the keys held there) rather than offering
  # any flexibility about which keys to use; that context defaults to the
  # process-default context, but may be explicitly specified.
