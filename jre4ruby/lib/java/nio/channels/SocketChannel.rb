  # A selectable channel for stream-oriented connecting sockets.
  # 
  # <p> Socket channels are not a complete abstraction of connecting network
  # sockets.  Binding, shutdown, and the manipulation of socket options must be
  # done through an associated {@link java.net.Socket} object obtained by
  # invoking the {@link #socket() socket} method.  It is not possible to create
  # a channel for an arbitrary, pre-existing socket, nor is it possible to
  # specify the {@link java.net.SocketImpl} object to be used by a socket
  # associated with a socket channel.
  # 
  # <p> A socket channel is created by invoking one of the {@link #open open}
  # methods of this class.  A newly-created socket channel is open but not yet
  # connected.  An attempt to invoke an I/O operation upon an unconnected
  # channel will cause a {@link NotYetConnectedException} to be thrown.  A
  # socket channel can be connected by invoking its {@link #connect connect}
  # method; once connected, a socket channel remains connected until it is
  # closed.  Whether or not a socket channel is connected may be determined by
  # invoking its {@link #isConnected isConnected} method.
  # 
  # <p> Socket channels support <i>non-blocking connection:</i>&nbsp;A socket
  # channel may be created and the process of establishing the link to the
  # remote socket may be initiated via the {@link #connect connect} method for
  # later completion by the {@link #finishConnect finishConnect} method.
  # Whether or not a connection operation is in progress may be determined by
  # invoking the {@link #isConnectionPending isConnectionPending} method.
  # 
  # <p> The input and output sides of a socket channel may independently be
  # <i>shut down</i> without actually closing the channel.  Shutting down the
  # input side of a channel by invoking the {@link java.net.Socket#shutdownInput
  # shutdownInput} method of an associated socket object will cause further
  # reads on the channel to return <tt>-1</tt>, the end-of-stream indication.
  # Shutting down the output side of the channel by invoking the {@link
  # java.net.Socket#shutdownOutput shutdownOutput} method of an associated
  # socket object will cause further writes on the channel to throw a {@link
  # ClosedChannelException}.
  # 
  # <p> Socket channels support <i>asynchronous shutdown,</i> which is similar
  # to the asynchronous close operation specified in the {@link Channel} class.
  # If the input side of a socket is shut down by one thread while another
  # thread is blocked in a read operation on the socket's channel, then the read
  # operation in the blocked thread will complete without reading any bytes and
  # will return <tt>-1</tt>.  If the output side of a socket is shut down by one
  # thread while another thread is blocked in a write operation on the socket's
  # channel, then the blocked thread will receive an {@link
  # AsynchronousCloseException}.
  # 
  # <p> Socket channels are safe for use by multiple concurrent threads.  They
  # support concurrent reading and writing, though at most one thread may be
  # reading and at most one thread may be writing at any given time.  The {@link
  # #connect connect} and {@link #finishConnect finishConnect} methods are
  # mutually synchronized against each other, and an attempt to initiate a read
  # or write operation while an invocation of one of these methods is in
  # progress will block until that invocation is complete.  </p>
