  # A pair of channels that implements a unidirectional pipe.
  # 
  # <p> A pipe consists of a pair of channels: A writable {@link
  # Pipe.SinkChannel </code>sink<code>} channel and a readable {@link
  # Pipe.SourceChannel </code>source<code>} channel.  Once some bytes are
  # written to the sink channel they can be read from source channel in exactly
  # the order in which they were written.
  # 
  # <p> Whether or not a thread writing bytes to a pipe will block until another
  # thread reads those bytes, or some previously-written bytes, from the pipe is
  # system-dependent and therefore unspecified.  Many pipe implementations will
  # buffer up to a certain number of bytes between the sink and source channels,
  # but such buffering should not be assumed.  </p>
