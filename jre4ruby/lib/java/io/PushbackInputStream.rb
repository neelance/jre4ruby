  # A <code>PushbackInputStream</code> adds
  # functionality to another input stream, namely
  # the  ability to "push back" or "unread"
  # one byte. This is useful in situations where
  # it is  convenient for a fragment of code
  # to read an indefinite number of data bytes
  # that  are delimited by a particular byte
  # value; after reading the terminating byte,
  # the  code fragment can "unread" it, so that
  # the next read operation on the input stream
  # will reread the byte that was pushed back.
  # For example, bytes representing the  characters
  # constituting an identifier might be terminated
  # by a byte representing an  operator character;
  # a method whose job is to read just an identifier
  # can read until it  sees the operator and
  # then push the operator back to be re-read.
