  # A piped output stream can be connected to a piped input stream
  # to create a communications pipe. The piped output stream is the
  # sending end of the pipe. Typically, data is written to a
  # <code>PipedOutputStream</code> object by one thread and data is
  # read from the connected <code>PipedInputStream</code> by some
  # other thread. Attempting to use both objects from a single thread
  # is not recommended as it may deadlock the thread.
  # The pipe is said to be <a name=BROKEN> <i>broken</i> </a> if a
  # thread that was reading data bytes from the connected piped input
  # stream is no longer alive.
