  # 
  # Writes text to a character-output stream, buffering characters so as to
  # provide for the efficient writing of single characters, arrays, and strings.
  # 
  # <p> The buffer size may be specified, or the default size may be accepted.
  # The default is large enough for most purposes.
  # 
  # <p> A newLine() method is provided, which uses the platform's own notion of
  # line separator as defined by the system property <tt>line.separator</tt>.
  # Not all platforms use the newline character ('\n') to terminate lines.
  # Calling this method to terminate each output line is therefore preferred to
  # writing a newline character directly.
  # 
  # <p> In general, a Writer sends its output immediately to the underlying
  # character or byte stream.  Unless prompt output is required, it is advisable
  # to wrap a BufferedWriter around any Writer whose write() operations may be
  # costly, such as FileWriters and OutputStreamWriters.  For example,
  # 
  # <pre>
  # PrintWriter out
  # = new PrintWriter(new BufferedWriter(new FileWriter("foo.out")));
  # </pre>
  # 
  # will buffer the PrintWriter's output to the file.  Without buffering, each
  # invocation of a print() method would cause characters to be converted into
  # bytes that would then be written immediately to the file, which can be very
  # inefficient.
