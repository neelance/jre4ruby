  # This class is an input stream filter that provides the added
  # functionality of keeping track of the current line number.
  # <p>
  # A line is a sequence of bytes ending with a carriage return
  # character (<code>'&#92;r'</code>), a newline character
  # (<code>'&#92;n'</code>), or a carriage return character followed
  # immediately by a linefeed character. In all three cases, the line
  # terminating character(s) are returned as a single newline character.
  # <p>
  # The line number begins at <code>0</code>, and is incremented by
  # <code>1</code> when a <code>read</code> returns a newline character.
  # 
  # @author     Arthur van Hoff
  # @see        java.io.LineNumberReader
  # @since      JDK1.0
  # @deprecated This class incorrectly assumes that bytes adequately represent
  # characters.  As of JDK&nbsp;1.1, the preferred way to operate on
  # character streams is via the new character-stream classes, which
  # include a class for counting line numbers.
