  # A subclass of RuleBasedBreakIterator that adds the ability to use a dictionary
  # to further subdivide ranges of text beyond what is possible using just the
  # state-table-based algorithm.  This is necessary, for example, to handle
  # word and line breaking in Thai, which doesn't use spaces between words.  The
  # state-table-based algorithm used by RuleBasedBreakIterator is used to divide
  # up text as far as possible, and then contiguous ranges of letters are
  # repeatedly compared against a list of known words (i.e., the dictionary)
  # to divide them up into words.
  # 
  # DictionaryBasedBreakIterator uses the same rule language as RuleBasedBreakIterator,
  # but adds one more special substitution name: &lt;dictionary&gt;.  This substitution
  # name is used to identify characters in words in the dictionary.  The idea is that
  # if the iterator passes over a chunk of text that includes two or more characters
  # in a row that are included in &lt;dictionary&gt;, it goes back through that range and
  # derives additional break positions (if possible) using the dictionary.
  # 
  # DictionaryBasedBreakIterator is also constructed with the filename of a dictionary
  # file.  It follows a prescribed search path to locate the dictionary (right now,
  # it looks for it in /com/ibm/text/resources in each directory in the classpath,
  # and won't find it in JAR files, but this location is likely to change).  The
  # dictionary file is in a serialized binary format.  We have a very primitive (and
  # slow) BuildDictionaryFile utility for creating dictionary files, but aren't
  # currently making it public.  Contact us for help.
