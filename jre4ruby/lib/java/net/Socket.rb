  # This class implements client sockets (also called just
  # "sockets"). A socket is an endpoint for communication
  # between two machines.
  # <p>
  # The actual work of the socket is performed by an instance of the
  # <code>SocketImpl</code> class. An application, by changing
  # the socket factory that creates the socket implementation,
  # can configure itself to create sockets appropriate to the local
  # firewall.
