  # This class implements server sockets. A server socket waits for
  # requests to come in over the network. It performs some operation
  # based on that request, and then possibly returns a result to the requester.
  # <p>
  # The actual work of the server socket is performed by an instance
  # of the <code>SocketImpl</code> class. An application can
  # change the socket factory that creates the socket
  # implementation to configure itself to create sockets
  # appropriate to the local firewall.
