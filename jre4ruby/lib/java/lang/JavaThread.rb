  # A <i>thread</i> is a thread of execution in a program. The Java
  # Virtual Machine allows an application to have multiple threads of
  # execution running concurrently.
  # <p>
  # Every thread has a priority. Threads with higher priority are
  # executed in preference to threads with lower priority. Each thread
  # may or may not also be marked as a daemon. When code running in
  # some thread creates a new <code>Thread</code> object, the new
  # thread has its priority initially set equal to the priority of the
  # creating thread, and is a daemon thread if and only if the
  # creating thread is a daemon.
  # <p>
  # When a Java Virtual Machine starts up, there is usually a single
  # non-daemon thread (which typically calls the method named
  # <code>main</code> of some designated class). The Java Virtual
  # Machine continues to execute threads until either of the following
  # occurs:
  # <ul>
  # <li>The <code>exit</code> method of class <code>Runtime</code> has been
  # called and the security manager has permitted the exit operation
  # to take place.
  # <li>All threads that are not daemon threads have died, either by
  # returning from the call to the <code>run</code> method or by
  # throwing an exception that propagates beyond the <code>run</code>
  # method.
  # </ul>
  # <p>
  # There are two ways to create a new thread of execution. One is to
  # declare a class to be a subclass of <code>Thread</code>. This
  # subclass should override the <code>run</code> method of class
  # <code>Thread</code>. An instance of the subclass can then be
  # allocated and started. For example, a thread that computes primes
  # larger than a stated value could be written as follows:
  # <p><hr><blockquote><pre>
  # class PrimeThread extends Thread {
  # long minPrime;
  # PrimeThread(long minPrime) {
  # this.minPrime = minPrime;
  # }
  # 
  # public void run() {
  # // compute primes larger than minPrime
  # &nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
  # }
  # }
  # </pre></blockquote><hr>
  # <p>
  # The following code would then create a thread and start it running:
  # <p><blockquote><pre>
  # PrimeThread p = new PrimeThread(143);
  # p.start();
  # </pre></blockquote>
  # <p>
  # The other way to create a thread is to declare a class that
  # implements the <code>Runnable</code> interface. That class then
  # implements the <code>run</code> method. An instance of the class can
  # then be allocated, passed as an argument when creating
  # <code>Thread</code>, and started. The same example in this other
  # style looks like the following:
  # <p><hr><blockquote><pre>
  # class PrimeRun implements Runnable {
  # long minPrime;
  # PrimeRun(long minPrime) {
  # this.minPrime = minPrime;
  # }
  # 
  # public void run() {
  # // compute primes larger than minPrime
  # &nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
  # }
  # }
  # </pre></blockquote><hr>
  # <p>
  # The following code would then create a thread and start it running:
  # <p><blockquote><pre>
  # PrimeRun p = new PrimeRun(143);
  # new Thread(p).start();
  # </pre></blockquote>
  # <p>
  # Every thread has a name for identification purposes. More than
  # one thread may have the same name. If a name is not specified when
  # a thread is created, a new name is generated for it.

    # <p>This constructor is identical to {@link
    # #Thread(ThreadGroup,Runnable,String)} with the exception of the fact
    # that it allows the thread stack size to be specified.  The stack size
    # is the approximate number of bytes of address space that the virtual
    # machine is to allocate for this thread's stack.  <b>The effect of the
    # <tt>stackSize</tt> parameter, if any, is highly platform dependent.</b>
    # 
    # <p>On some platforms, specifying a higher value for the
    # <tt>stackSize</tt> parameter may allow a thread to achieve greater
    # recursion depth before throwing a {@link StackOverflowError}.
    # Similarly, specifying a lower value may allow a greater number of
    # threads to exist concurrently without throwing an {@link
    # OutOfMemoryError} (or other internal error).  The details of
    # the relationship between the value of the <tt>stackSize</tt> parameter
    # and the maximum recursion depth and concurrency level are
    # platform-dependent.  <b>On some platforms, the value of the
    # <tt>stackSize</tt> parameter may have no effect whatsoever.</b>
    # 
    # <p>The virtual machine is free to treat the <tt>stackSize</tt>
    # parameter as a suggestion.  If the specified value is unreasonably low
    # for the platform, the virtual machine may instead use some
    # platform-specific minimum value; if the specified value is unreasonably
    # high, the virtual machine may instead use some platform-specific
    # maximum.  Likewise, the virtual machine is free to round the specified
    # value up or down as it sees fit (or to ignore it completely).
    # 
    # <p>Specifying a value of zero for the <tt>stackSize</tt> parameter will
    # cause this constructor to behave exactly like the
    # <tt>Thread(ThreadGroup, Runnable, String)</tt> constructor.
    # 
    # <p><i>Due to the platform-dependent nature of the behavior of this
    # constructor, extreme care should be exercised in its use.
    # The thread stack size necessary to perform a given computation will
    # likely vary from one JRE implementation to another.  In light of this

    # and the tuning may need to be repeated for each JRE implementation on
    # which an application is to run.</i>
