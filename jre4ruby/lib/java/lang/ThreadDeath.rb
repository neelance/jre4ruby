  # An instance of {@code ThreadDeath} is thrown in the victim thread
  # when the (deprecated) {@link Thread#stop()} method is invoked.
  # 
  # <p>An application should catch instances of this class only if it
  # must clean up after being terminated asynchronously.  If
  # {@code ThreadDeath} is caught by a method, it is important that it
  # be rethrown so that the thread actually dies.
  # 
  # <p>The {@linkplain ThreadGroup#uncaughtException top-level error
  # handler} does not print out a message if {@code ThreadDeath} is
  # never caught.
  # 
  # <p>The class {@code ThreadDeath} is specifically a subclass of
  # {@code Error} rather than {@code Exception}, even though it is a
  # "normal occurrence", because many applications catch all
  # occurrences of {@code Exception} and then discard the exception.
