  # Information about a <em>lock</em>.  A lock can be a built-in object monitor,
  # an <em>ownable synchronizer</em>, or the {@link Condition Condition}
  # object associated with synchronizers.
  # <p>
  # <a name="OwnableSynchronizer">An ownable synchronizer</a> is
  # a synchronizer that may be exclusively owned by a thread and uses
  # {@link AbstractOwnableSynchronizer AbstractOwnableSynchronizer}
  # (or its subclass) to implement its synchronization property.
  # {@link ReentrantLock ReentrantLock} and
  # {@link ReentrantReadWriteLock ReentrantReadWriteLock} are
  # two examples of ownable synchronizers provided by the platform.
  # 
  # <h4><a name="MappedType">MXBean Mapping</a></h4>
  # <tt>LockInfo</tt> is mapped to a {@link CompositeData CompositeData}
  # as specified in the <a href="../../../javax/management/MXBean.html#mapping-rules">
  # type mapping rules</a> of {@linkplain javax.management.MXBean MXBeans}.
