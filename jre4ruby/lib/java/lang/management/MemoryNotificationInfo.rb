  # The information about a memory notification.
  # 
  # <p>
  # A memory notification is emitted by {@link MemoryMXBean}
  # when the Java virtual machine detects that the memory usage
  # of a memory pool is exceeding a threshold value.
  # The notification emitted will contain the memory notification
  # information about the detected condition:
  # <ul>
  # <li>The name of the memory pool.</li>
  # <li>The memory usage of the memory pool when the notification
  # was constructed.</li>
  # <li>The number of times that the memory usage has crossed
  # a threshold when the notification was constructed.
  # For usage threshold notifications, this count will be the
  # {@link MemoryPoolMXBean#getUsageThresholdCount usage threshold
  # count}.  For collection threshold notifications,
  # this count will be the
  # {@link MemoryPoolMXBean#getCollectionUsageThresholdCount
  # collection usage threshold count}.
  # </li>
  # </ul>
  # 
  # <p>
  # A {@link CompositeData CompositeData} representing
  # the <tt>MemoryNotificationInfo</tt> object
  # is stored in the
  # {@link javax.management.Notification#setUserData user data}
  # of a {@link javax.management.Notification notification}.
  # The {@link #from from} method is provided to convert from
  # a <tt>CompositeData</tt> to a <tt>MemoryNotificationInfo</tt>
  # object. For example:
  # 
  # <blockquote><pre>
  # Notification notif;
  # 
  # // receive the notification emitted by MemoryMXBean and set to notif
  # ...
  # 
  # String notifType = notif.getType();
  # if (notifType.equals(MemoryNotificationInfo.MEMORY_THRESHOLD_EXCEEDED) ||
  # notifType.equals(MemoryNotificationInfo.MEMORY_COLLECTION_THRESHOLD_EXCEEDED)) {
  # // retrieve the memory notification information
  # CompositeData cd = (CompositeData) notif.getUserData();
  # MemoryNotificationInfo info = MemoryNotificationInfo.from(cd);
  # ....
  # }
  # </pre></blockquote>
  # 
  # <p>
  # The types of notifications emitted by <tt>MemoryMXBean</tt> are:
  # <ul>
  # <li>A {@link #MEMORY_THRESHOLD_EXCEEDED
  # usage threshold exceeded notification}.
  # <br>This notification will be emitted when
  # the memory usage of a memory pool is increased and has reached
  # or exceeded its
  # <a href="MemoryPoolMXBean.html#UsageThreshold"> usage threshold</a> value.
  # Subsequent crossing of the usage threshold value does not cause
  # further notification until the memory usage has returned
  # to become less than the usage threshold value.
  # <p></li>
  # <li>A {@link #MEMORY_COLLECTION_THRESHOLD_EXCEEDED
  # collection usage threshold exceeded notification}.
  # <br>This notification will be emitted when
  # the memory usage of a memory pool is greater than or equal to its
  # <a href="MemoryPoolMXBean.html#CollectionThreshold">
  # collection usage threshold</a> after the Java virtual machine
  # has expended effort in recycling unused objects in that
  # memory pool.</li>
