    # 
    # <p> The virtual machine's shutdown sequence consists of two phases.  In

    # Registers a new virtual-machine shutdown hook.
    # 
    # <p> The Java virtual machine <i>shuts down</i> in response to two kinds
    # of events:
    # 
    # <ul>
    # 
    # <p> <li> The program <i>exits</i> normally, when the last non-daemon
    # thread exits or when the <tt>{@link #exit exit}</tt> (equivalently,
    # <tt>{@link System#exit(int) System.exit}</tt>) method is invoked, or
    # 
    # <p> <li> The virtual machine is <i>terminated</i> in response to a
    # user interrupt, such as typing <tt>^C</tt>, or a system-wide event,
    # such as user logoff or system shutdown.
    # 
    # </ul>
    # 
    # <p> A <i>shutdown hook</i> is simply an initialized but unstarted
    # thread.  When the virtual machine begins its shutdown sequence it will
    # start all registered shutdown hooks in some unspecified order and let
    # them run concurrently.  When all the hooks have finished it will then
    # run all uninvoked finalizers if finalization-on-exit has been enabled.
    # Finally, the virtual machine will halt.  Note that daemon threads will
    # continue to run during the shutdown sequence, as will non-daemon threads
    # if shutdown was initiated by invoking the <tt>{@link #exit exit}</tt>
    # method.
    # 
    # <p> Once the shutdown sequence has begun it can be stopped only by
    # invoking the <tt>{@link #halt halt}</tt> method, which forcibly
    # terminates the virtual machine.
    # 
    # <p> Once the shutdown sequence has begun it is impossible to register a
    # new shutdown hook or de-register a previously-registered hook.
    # Attempting either of these operations will cause an
    # <tt>{@link IllegalStateException}</tt> to be thrown.
    # 
    # <p> Shutdown hooks run at a delicate time in the life cycle of a virtual
    # machine and should therefore be coded defensively.  They should, in
    # particular, be written to be thread-safe and to avoid deadlocks insofar
    # as possible.  They should also not rely blindly upon services that may
    # have registered their own shutdown hooks and therefore may themselves in
    # the process of shutting down.  Attempts to use other thread-based
    # services such as the AWT event-dispatch thread, for example, may lead to
    # deadlocks.
    # 
    # <p> Shutdown hooks should also finish their work quickly.  When a
    # program invokes <tt>{@link #exit exit}</tt> the expectation is
    # that the virtual machine will promptly shut down and exit.  When the
    # virtual machine is terminated due to user logoff or system shutdown the
    # underlying operating system may only allow a fixed amount of time in
    # which to shut down and exit.  It is therefore inadvisable to attempt any
    # user interaction or to perform a long-running computation in a shutdown
    # hook.
    # 
    # <p> Uncaught exceptions are handled in shutdown hooks just as in any
    # other thread, by invoking the <tt>{@link ThreadGroup#uncaughtException
    # uncaughtException}</tt> method of the thread's <tt>{@link
    # ThreadGroup}</tt> object.  The default implementation of this method
    # prints the exception's stack trace to <tt>{@link System#err}</tt> and
    # terminates the thread; it does not cause the virtual machine to exit or
    # halt.
    # 
    # <p> In rare circumstances the virtual machine may <i>abort</i>, that is,
    # stop running without shutting down cleanly.  This occurs when the
    # virtual machine is terminated externally, for example with the
    # <tt>SIGKILL</tt> signal on Unix or the <tt>TerminateProcess</tt> call on
    # Microsoft Windows.  The virtual machine may also abort if a native
    # method goes awry by, for example, corrupting internal data structures or
    # attempting to access nonexistent memory.  If the virtual machine aborts
    # then no guarantee can be made about whether or not any shutdown hooks
