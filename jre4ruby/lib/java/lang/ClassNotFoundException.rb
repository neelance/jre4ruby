  # Thrown when an application tries to load in a class through its
  # string name using:
  # <ul>
  # <li>The <code>forName</code> method in class <code>Class</code>.
  # <li>The <code>findSystemClass</code> method in class
  # <code>ClassLoader</code> .
  # <li>The <code>loadClass</code> method in class <code>ClassLoader</code>.
  # </ul>
  # <p>
  # but no definition for the class with the specified name could be found.
  # 
  # <p>As of release 1.4, this exception has been retrofitted to conform to
  # the general purpose exception-chaining mechanism.  The "optional exception
  # that was raised while loading the class" that may be provided at
  # construction time and accessed via the {@link #getException()} method is
  # now known as the <i>cause</i>, and may be accessed via the {@link
  # Throwable#getCause()} method, as well as the aforementioned "legacy method."
