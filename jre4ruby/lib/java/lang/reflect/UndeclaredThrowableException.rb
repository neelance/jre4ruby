  # Thrown by a method invocation on a proxy instance if its invocation
  # handler's {@link InvocationHandler#invoke invoke} method throws a
  # checked exception (a {@code Throwable} that is not assignable
  # to {@code RuntimeException} or {@code Error}) that
  # is not assignable to any of the exception types declared in the
  # {@code throws} clause of the method that was invoked on the
  # proxy instance and dispatched to the invocation handler.
  # 
  # <p>An {@code UndeclaredThrowableException} instance contains
  # the undeclared checked exception that was thrown by the invocation
  # handler, and it can be retrieved with the
  # {@code getUndeclaredThrowable()} method.
  # {@code UndeclaredThrowableException} extends
  # {@code RuntimeException}, so it is an unchecked exception
  # that wraps a checked exception.
  # 
  # <p>As of release 1.4, this exception has been retrofitted to
  # conform to the general purpose exception-chaining mechanism.  The
  # "undeclared checked exception that was thrown by the invocation
  # handler" that may be provided at construction time and accessed via
  # the {@link #getUndeclaredThrowable()} method is now known as the
  # <i>cause</i>, and may be accessed via the {@link
  # Throwable#getCause()} method, as well as the aforementioned "legacy
  # method."
