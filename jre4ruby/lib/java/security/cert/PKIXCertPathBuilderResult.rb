  # This class represents the successful result of the PKIX certification
  # path builder algorithm. All certification paths that are built and
  # returned using this algorithm are also validated according to the PKIX
  # certification path validation algorithm.
  # 
  # <p>Instances of <code>PKIXCertPathBuilderResult</code> are returned by
  # the <code>build</code> method of <code>CertPathBuilder</code>
  # objects implementing the PKIX algorithm.
  # 
  # <p>All <code>PKIXCertPathBuilderResult</code> objects contain the
  # certification path constructed by the build algorithm, the
  # valid policy tree and subject public key resulting from the build
  # algorithm, and a <code>TrustAnchor</code> describing the certification
  # authority (CA) that served as a trust anchor for the certification path.
  # <p>
  # <b>Concurrent Access</b>
  # <p>
  # Unless otherwise specified, the methods defined in this class are not
  # thread-safe. Multiple threads that need to access a single
  # object concurrently should synchronize amongst themselves and
  # provide the necessary locking. Multiple threads each manipulating
  # separate objects need not synchronize.
