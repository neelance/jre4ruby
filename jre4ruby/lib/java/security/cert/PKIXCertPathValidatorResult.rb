  # This class represents the successful result of the PKIX certification
  # path validation algorithm.
  # 
  # <p>Instances of <code>PKIXCertPathValidatorResult</code> are returned by the
  # {@link CertPathValidator#validate validate} method of
  # <code>CertPathValidator</code> objects implementing the PKIX algorithm.
  # 
  # <p> All <code>PKIXCertPathValidatorResult</code> objects contain the
  # valid policy tree and subject public key resulting from the
  # validation algorithm, as well as a <code>TrustAnchor</code> describing
  # the certification authority (CA) that served as a trust anchor for the
  # certification path.
  # <p>
  # <b>Concurrent Access</b>
  # <p>
  # Unless otherwise specified, the methods defined in this class are not
  # thread-safe. Multiple threads that need to access a single
  # object concurrently should synchronize amongst themselves and
  # provide the necessary locking. Multiple threads each manipulating
  # separate objects need not synchronize.
