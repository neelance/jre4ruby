  # <p> This exception is thrown by the AccessController to indicate
  # that a requested access (to a critical system resource such as the
  # file system or the network) is denied.
  # 
  # <p> The reason to deny access can vary.  For example, the requested
  # permission might be of an incorrect type,  contain an invalid
  # value, or request access that is not allowed according to the
  # security policy.  Such information should be given whenever
  # possible at the time the exception is thrown.
