  # represents an entity such as an individual user or a company). <p>

  # Note that Group extends Principal. Thus, either a Principal or a Group can
  # be passed as an argument to methods containing a Principal parameter. For
  # example, you can add either a Principal or a Group to a Group object by
  # calling the object's <code>addMember</code> method, passing it the
  # Principal or Group.
