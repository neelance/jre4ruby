  # <p>This class represents a scope for identities. It is an Identity
  # itself, and therefore has a name and can have a scope. It can also
  # optionally have a public key and associated certificates.
  # 
  # <p>An IdentityScope can contain Identity objects of all kinds, including
  # Signers. All types of Identity objects can be retrieved, added, and
  # removed using the same methods. Note that it is possible, and in fact
  # expected, that different types of identity scopes will
  # apply different policies for their various operations on the
  # various types of Identities.
  # 
  # <p>There is a one-to-one mapping between keys and identities, and
  # there can only be one copy of one key per scope. For example, suppose
  # <b>Acme Software, Inc</b> is a software publisher known to a user.
  # Suppose it is an Identity, that is, it has a public key, and a set of
  # associated certificates. It is named in the scope using the name
  # "Acme Software". No other named Identity in the scope has the same
  # public  key. Of course, none has the same name as well.
