  # This class implements the <tt>Set</tt> interface, backed by a hash table
  # (actually a <tt>HashMap</tt> instance).  It makes no guarantees as to the
  # iteration order of the set; in particular, it does not guarantee that the
  # order will remain constant over time.  This class permits the <tt>null</tt>
  # element.
  # 
  # <p>This class offers constant time performance for the basic operations
  # (<tt>add</tt>, <tt>remove</tt>, <tt>contains</tt> and <tt>size</tt>),
  # assuming the hash function disperses the elements properly among the
  # buckets.  Iterating over this set requires time proportional to the sum of
  # the <tt>HashSet</tt> instance's size (the number of elements) plus the
  # "capacity" of the backing <tt>HashMap</tt> instance (the number of
  # buckets).  Thus, it's very important not to set the initial capacity too
  # high (or the load factor too low) if iteration performance is important.
  # 
  # <p><strong>Note that this implementation is not synchronized.</strong>
  # If multiple threads access a hash set concurrently, and at least one of
  # the threads modifies the set, it <i>must</i> be synchronized externally.
  # This is typically accomplished by synchronizing on some object that
  # naturally encapsulates the set.
  # 
  # If no such object exists, the set should be "wrapped" using the
  # {@link Collections#synchronizedSet Collections.synchronizedSet}
  # method.  This is best done at creation time, to prevent accidental
  # unsynchronized access to the set:<pre>
  # Set s = Collections.synchronizedSet(new HashSet(...));</pre>
  # 
  # <p>The iterators returned by this class's <tt>iterator</tt> method are
  # <i>fail-fast</i>: if the set is modified at any time after the iterator is
  # created, in any way except through the iterator's own <tt>remove</tt>
  # method, the Iterator throws a {@link ConcurrentModificationException}.
  # Thus, in the face of concurrent modification, the iterator fails quickly
  # and cleanly, rather than risking arbitrary, non-deterministic behavior at
  # an undetermined time in the future.
  # 
  # <p>Note that the fail-fast behavior of an iterator cannot be guaranteed
  # as it is, generally speaking, impossible to make any hard guarantees in the
  # presence of unsynchronized concurrent modification.  Fail-fast iterators
  # throw <tt>ConcurrentModificationException</tt> on a best-effort basis.
  # Therefore, it would be wrong to write a program that depended on this
  # exception for its correctness: <i>the fail-fast behavior of iterators
  # should be used only to detect bugs.</i>
