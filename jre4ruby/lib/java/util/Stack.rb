  # The <code>Stack</code> class represents a last-in-first-out
  # (LIFO) stack of objects. It extends class <tt>Vector</tt> with five
  # operations that allow a vector to be treated as a stack. The usual
  # <tt>push</tt> and <tt>pop</tt> operations are provided, as well as a
  # method to <tt>peek</tt> at the top item on the stack, a method to test
  # for whether the stack is <tt>empty</tt>, and a method to <tt>search</tt>
  # the stack for an item and discover how far it is from the top.
  # <p>
  # When a stack is first created, it contains no items.
  # 
  # <p>A more complete and consistent set of LIFO stack operations is
  # provided by the {@link Deque} interface and its implementations, which
  # should be used in preference to this class.  For example:
  # <pre>   {@code
  # Deque<Integer> stack = new ArrayDeque<Integer>();}</pre>
