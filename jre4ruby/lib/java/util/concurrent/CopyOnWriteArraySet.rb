  # A {@link java.util.Set} that uses an internal {@link CopyOnWriteArrayList}
  # for all of its operations.  Thus, it shares the same basic properties:
  # <ul>
  # <li>It is best suited for applications in which set sizes generally
  # stay small, read-only operations
  # vastly outnumber mutative operations, and you need
  # to prevent interference among threads during traversal.
  # <li>It is thread-safe.
  # <li>Mutative operations (<tt>add</tt>, <tt>set</tt>, <tt>remove</tt>, etc.)
  # are expensive since they usually entail copying the entire underlying
  # array.
  # <li>Iterators do not support the mutative <tt>remove</tt> operation.
  # <li>Traversal via iterators is fast and cannot encounter
  # interference from other threads. Iterators rely on
  # unchanging snapshots of the array at the time the iterators were
  # constructed.
  # </ul>
  # 
  # <p> <b>Sample Usage.</b> The following code sketch uses a
  # copy-on-write set to maintain a set of Handler objects that
  # perform some action upon state updates.
  # 
  # <pre>
  # class Handler { void handle(); ... }
  # 
  # class X {
  # private final CopyOnWriteArraySet&lt;Handler&gt; handlers
  # = new CopyOnWriteArraySet&lt;Handler&gt;();
  # public void addHandler(Handler h) { handlers.add(h); }
  # 
  # private long internalState;
  # private synchronized void changeState() { internalState = ...; }
  # 
  # public void update() {
  # changeState();
  # for (Handler handler : handlers)
  # handler.handle();
  # }
  # }
  # </pre>
