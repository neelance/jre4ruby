  # An implementation of {@link ReadWriteLock} supporting similar
  # semantics to {@link ReentrantLock}.
  # <p>This class has the following properties:
  # 
  # <ul>
  # <li><b>Acquisition order</b>
  # 
  # <p> This class does not impose a reader or writer preference
  # ordering for lock access.  However, it does support an optional
  # <em>fairness</em> policy.
  # 
  # <dl>
  # <dt><b><i>Non-fair mode (default)</i></b>
  # <dd>When constructed as non-fair (the default), the order of entry
  # to the read and write lock is unspecified, subject to reentrancy
  # constraints.  A nonfair lock that is continuously contended may
  # indefinitely postpone one or more reader or writer threads, but
  # will normally have higher throughput than a fair lock.
  # <p>
  # 
  # <dt><b><i>Fair mode</i></b>
  # <dd> When constructed as fair, threads contend for entry using an
  # approximately arrival-order policy. When the currently held lock
  # is released either the longest-waiting single writer thread will
  # be assigned the write lock, or if there is a group of reader threads
  # waiting longer than all waiting writer threads, that group will be
  # assigned the read lock.
  # 
  # <p>A thread that tries to acquire a fair read lock (non-reentrantly)
  # will block if either the write lock is held, or there is a waiting
  # writer thread. The thread will not acquire the read lock until
  # after the oldest currently waiting writer thread has acquired and
  # released the write lock. Of course, if a waiting writer abandons
  # its wait, leaving one or more reader threads as the longest waiters
  # in the queue with the write lock free, then those readers will be
  # assigned the read lock.
  # 
  # <p>A thread that tries to acquire a fair write lock (non-reentrantly)
  # will block unless both the read lock and write lock are free (which
  # implies there are no waiting threads).  (Note that the non-blocking
  # {@link ReadLock#tryLock()} and {@link WriteLock#tryLock()} methods
  # do not honor this fair setting and will acquire the lock if it is
  # possible, regardless of waiting threads.)
  # <p>
  # </dl>
  # 
  # <li><b>Reentrancy</b>
  # 
  # <p>This lock allows both readers and writers to reacquire read or
  # write locks in the style of a {@link ReentrantLock}. Non-reentrant
  # readers are not allowed until all write locks held by the writing
  # thread have been released.
  # 
  # <p>Additionally, a writer can acquire the read lock, but not
  # vice-versa.  Among other applications, reentrancy can be useful
  # when write locks are held during calls or callbacks to methods that
  # perform reads under read locks.  If a reader tries to acquire the
  # write lock it will never succeed.
  # 
  # <li><b>Lock downgrading</b>
  # <p>Reentrancy also allows downgrading from the write lock to a read lock,
  # by acquiring the write lock, then the read lock and then releasing the
  # write lock. However, upgrading from a read lock to the write lock is
  # <b>not</b> possible.
  # 
  # <li><b>Interruption of lock acquisition</b>
  # <p>The read lock and write lock both support interruption during lock
  # acquisition.
  # 
  # <li><b>{@link Condition} support</b>
  # <p>The write lock provides a {@link Condition} implementation that
  # behaves in the same way, with respect to the write lock, as the
  # {@link Condition} implementation provided by
  # {@link ReentrantLock#newCondition} does for {@link ReentrantLock}.
  # This {@link Condition} can, of course, only be used with the write lock.
  # 
  # <p>The read lock does not support a {@link Condition} and
  # {@code readLock().newCondition()} throws
  # {@code UnsupportedOperationException}.
  # 
  # <li><b>Instrumentation</b>
  # <p>This class supports methods to determine whether locks
  # are held or contended. These methods are designed for monitoring
  # system state, not for synchronization control.
  # </ul>
  # 
  # <p>Serialization of this class behaves in the same way as built-in
  # locks: a deserialized lock is in the unlocked state, regardless of
  # its state when serialized.
  # 
  # <p><b>Sample usages</b>. Here is a code sketch showing how to perform
  # lock downgrading after updating a cache (exception handling is
  # particularly tricky when handling multiple locks in a non-nested
  # fashion):
  # 
  # <pre> {@code
  # class CachedData {
  # Object data;
  # volatile boolean cacheValid;
  # final ReentrantReadWriteLock rwl = new ReentrantReadWriteLock();
  # 
  # void processCachedData() {
  # rwl.readLock().lock();
  # if (!cacheValid) {
  # // Must release read lock before acquiring write lock
  # rwl.readLock().unlock();
  # rwl.writeLock().lock();
  # try {
  # // Recheck state because another thread might have
  # // acquired write lock and changed state before we did.
  # if (!cacheValid) {
  # data = ...
  # cacheValid = true;
  # }
  # // Downgrade by acquiring read lock before releasing write lock
  # rwl.readLock().lock();
  # } finally  {
  # rwl.writeLock().unlock(); // Unlock write, still hold read
  # }
  # }
  # 
  # try {
  # use(data);
  # } finally {
  # rwl.readLock().unlock();
  # }
  # }
  # }}</pre>
  # 
  # ReentrantReadWriteLocks can be used to improve concurrency in some
  # uses of some kinds of Collections. This is typically worthwhile
  # only when the collections are expected to be large, accessed by
  # more reader threads than writer threads, and entail operations with
  # overhead that outweighs synchronization overhead. For example, here
  # is a class using a TreeMap that is expected to be large and
  # concurrently accessed.
  # 
  # <pre>{@code
  # class RWDictionary {
  # private final Map<String, Data> m = new TreeMap<String, Data>();
  # private final ReentrantReadWriteLock rwl = new ReentrantReadWriteLock();
  # private final Lock r = rwl.readLock();
  # private final Lock w = rwl.writeLock();
  # 
  # public Data get(String key) {
  # r.lock();
  # try { return m.get(key); }
  # finally { r.unlock(); }
  # }
  # public String[] allKeys() {
  # r.lock();
  # try { return m.keySet().toArray(); }
  # finally { r.unlock(); }
  # }
  # public Data put(String key, Data value) {
  # w.lock();
  # try { return m.put(key, value); }
  # finally { w.unlock(); }
  # }
  # public void clear() {
  # w.lock();
  # try { m.clear(); }
  # finally { w.unlock(); }
  # }
  # }}</pre>
  # 
  # <h3>Implementation Notes</h3>
  # 
  # <p>This lock supports a maximum of 65535 recursive write locks
  # and 65535 read locks. Attempts to exceed these limits result in
  # {@link Error} throws from locking methods.
  # 
  # @since 1.5
