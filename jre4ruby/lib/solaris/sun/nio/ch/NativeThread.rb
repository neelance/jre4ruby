  # Signalling operations on native threads
  # 
  # On some operating systems (e.g., Linux), closing a channel while another
  # thread is blocked in an I/O operation upon that channel does not cause that
  # thread to be released.  This class provides access to the native threads
  # upon which Java threads are built, and defines a simple signal mechanism
  # that can be used to release a native thread from a blocking I/O operation.
  # On systems that do not require this type of signalling, the current() method
  # always returns -1 and the signal(long) method has no effect.
