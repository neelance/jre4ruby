  # The <code>RuleBasedCollator</code> class is a concrete subclass of
  # <code>Collator</code> that provides a simple, data-driven, table
  # collator.  With this class you can create a customized table-based
  # <code>Collator</code>.  <code>RuleBasedCollator</code> maps
  # characters to sort keys.
  # 
  # <p>
  # <code>RuleBasedCollator</code> has the following restrictions
  # for efficiency (other subclasses may be used for more complex languages) :
  # <ol>
  # <li>If a special collation rule controlled by a &lt;modifier&gt; is
  #    specified it applies to the whole collator object.
  # <li>All non-mentioned characters are at the end of the
  #     collation order.
  # </ol>
  # 
  # <p>
  # The collation table is composed of a list of collation rules, where each
  # rule is of one of three forms:
  # <pre>
  #    &lt;modifier&gt;
  #    &lt;relation&gt; &lt;text-argument&gt;
  #    &lt;reset&gt; &lt;text-argument&gt;
  # </pre>
  # The definitions of the rule elements is as follows:
  # <UL Type=disc>
  #    <LI><strong>Text-Argument</strong>: A text-argument is any sequence of
  #        characters, excluding special characters (that is, common
  #        whitespace characters [0009-000D, 0020] and rule syntax characters
  #        [0021-002F, 003A-0040, 005B-0060, 007B-007E]). If those
  #        characters are desired, you can put them in single quotes
  #        (e.g. ampersand => '&'). Note that unquoted white space characters
  #        are ignored; e.g. <code>b c</code> is treated as <code>bc</code>.
  #    <LI><strong>Modifier</strong>: There are currently two modifiers that
  #        turn on special collation rules.
  #        <UL Type=square>
  #            <LI>'@' : Turns on backwards sorting of accents (secondary
  #                      differences), as in French.
  #            <LI>'!' : Turns on Thai/Lao vowel-consonant swapping.  If this
  #                      rule is in force when a Thai vowel of the range
  #                      &#92;U0E40-&#92;U0E44 precedes a Thai consonant of the range
  #                      &#92;U0E01-&#92;U0E2E OR a Lao vowel of the range &#92;U0EC0-&#92;U0EC4
  #                      precedes a Lao consonant of the range &#92;U0E81-&#92;U0EAE then
  #                      the vowel is placed after the consonant for collation
  #                      purposes.
  #        </UL>
  #        <p>'@' : Indicates that accents are sorted backwards, as in French.
  #    <LI><strong>Relation</strong>: The relations are the following:
  #        <UL Type=square>
  #            <LI>'&lt;' : Greater, as a letter difference (primary)
  #            <LI>';' : Greater, as an accent difference (secondary)
  #            <LI>',' : Greater, as a case difference (tertiary)
  #            <LI>'=' : Equal
  #        </UL>
  #    <LI><strong>Reset</strong>: There is a single reset
  #        which is used primarily for contractions and expansions, but which
  #        can also be used to add a modification at the end of a set of rules.
  #        <p>'&' : Indicates that the next rule follows the position to where
  #            the reset text-argument would be sorted.
  # </UL>
  # 
  # <p>
  # This sounds more complicated than it is in practice. For example, the
  # following are equivalent ways of expressing the same thing:
  # <blockquote>
  # <pre>
  # a &lt; b &lt; c
  # a &lt; b &amp; b &lt; c
  # a &lt; c &amp; a &lt; b
  # </pre>
  # </blockquote>
  # Notice that the order is important, as the subsequent item goes immediately
  # after the text-argument. The following are not equivalent:
  # <blockquote>
  # <pre>
  # a &lt; b &amp; a &lt; c
  # a &lt; c &amp; a &lt; b
  # </pre>
  # </blockquote>
  # Either the text-argument must already be present in the sequence, or some
  # initial substring of the text-argument must be present. (e.g. "a &lt; b &amp; ae &lt;
  # e" is valid since "a" is present in the sequence before "ae" is reset). In
  # this latter case, "ae" is not entered and treated as a single character;
  # instead, "e" is sorted as if it were expanded to two characters: "a"
  # followed by an "e". This difference appears in natural languages: in
  # traditional Spanish "ch" is treated as though it contracts to a single
  # character (expressed as "c &lt; ch &lt; d"), while in traditional German
  # a-umlaut is treated as though it expanded to two characters
  # (expressed as "a,A &lt; b,B ... &amp;ae;&#92;u00e3&amp;AE;&#92;u00c3").
  # [&#92;u00e3 and &#92;u00c3 are, of course, the escape sequences for a-umlaut.]
  # <p>
  # <strong>Ignorable Characters</strong>
  # <p>
  # For ignorable characters, the first rule must start with a relation (the
  # examples we have used above are really fragments; "a &lt; b" really should be
  # "&lt; a &lt; b"). If, however, the first relation is not "&lt;", then all the all
  # text-arguments up to the first "&lt;" are ignorable. For example, ", - &lt; a &lt; b"
  # makes "-" an ignorable character, as we saw earlier in the word
  # "black-birds". In the samples for different languages, you see that most
  # accents are ignorable.
  # 
  # <p><strong>Normalization and Accents</strong>
  # <p>
  # <code>RuleBasedCollator</code> automatically processes its rule table to
  # include both pre-composed and combining-character versions of
  # accented characters.  Even if the provided rule string contains only
  # base characters and separate combining accent characters, the pre-composed
  # accented characters matching all canonical combinations of characters from
  # the rule string will be entered in the table.
  # <p>
  # This allows you to use a RuleBasedCollator to compare accented strings
  # even when the collator is set to NO_DECOMPOSITION.  There are two caveats,
  # however.  First, if the strings to be collated contain combining
  # sequences that may not be in canonical order, you should set the collator to
  # CANONICAL_DECOMPOSITION or FULL_DECOMPOSITION to enable sorting of
  # combining sequences.  Second, if the strings contain characters with
  # compatibility decompositions (such as full-width and half-width forms),
  # you must use FULL_DECOMPOSITION, since the rule tables only include
  # canonical mappings.
  # 
  # <p><strong>Errors</strong>
  # <p>
  # The following are errors:
  # <UL Type=disc>
  #     <LI>A text-argument contains unquoted punctuation symbols
  #        (e.g. "a &lt; b-c &lt; d").
  #     <LI>A relation or reset character not followed by a text-argument
  #        (e.g. "a &lt; ,b").
  #     <LI>A reset where the text-argument (or an initial substring of the
  #         text-argument) is not already in the sequence.
  #         (e.g. "a &lt; b &amp; e &lt; f")
  # </UL>
  # If you produce one of these errors, a <code>RuleBasedCollator</code> throws
  # a <code>ParseException</code>.
  # 
  # <p><strong>Examples</strong>
  # <p>Simple:     "&lt; a &lt; b &lt; c &lt; d"
  # <p>Norwegian:  "&lt; a,A&lt; b,B&lt; c,C&lt; d,D&lt; e,E&lt; f,F&lt; g,G&lt; h,H&lt; i,I&lt; j,J
  #                 &lt; k,K&lt; l,L&lt; m,M&lt; n,N&lt; o,O&lt; p,P&lt; q,Q&lt; r,R&lt; s,S&lt; t,T
  #                 &lt; u,U&lt; v,V&lt; w,W&lt; x,X&lt; y,Y&lt; z,Z
  #                 &lt; &#92;u00E5=a&#92;u030A,&#92;u00C5=A&#92;u030A
  #                 ;aa,AA&lt; &#92;u00E6,&#92;u00C6&lt; &#92;u00F8,&#92;u00D8"
  # 
  # <p>
  # To create a <code>RuleBasedCollator</code> object with specialized
  # rules tailored to your needs, you construct the <code>RuleBasedCollator</code>
  # with the rules contained in a <code>String</code> object. For example:
  # <blockquote>
  # <pre>
  # String simple = "&lt; a&lt; b&lt; c&lt; d";
  # RuleBasedCollator mySimple = new RuleBasedCollator(simple);
  # </pre>
  # </blockquote>
  # Or:
  # <blockquote>
  # <pre>
  # String Norwegian = "&lt; a,A&lt; b,B&lt; c,C&lt; d,D&lt; e,E&lt; f,F&lt; g,G&lt; h,H&lt; i,I&lt; j,J" +
  #                 "&lt; k,K&lt; l,L&lt; m,M&lt; n,N&lt; o,O&lt; p,P&lt; q,Q&lt; r,R&lt; s,S&lt; t,T" +
  #                 "&lt; u,U&lt; v,V&lt; w,W&lt; x,X&lt; y,Y&lt; z,Z" +
  #                 "&lt; &#92;u00E5=a&#92;u030A,&#92;u00C5=A&#92;u030A" +
  #                 ";aa,AA&lt; &#92;u00E6,&#92;u00C6&lt; &#92;u00F8,&#92;u00D8";
  # RuleBasedCollator myNorwegian = new RuleBasedCollator(Norwegian);
  # </pre>
  # </blockquote>
  # 
  # <p>
  # A new collation rules string can be created by concatenating rules
  # strings. For example, the rules returned by {@link #getRules()} could
  # be concatenated to combine multiple <code>RuleBasedCollator</code>s.
  # 
  # <p>
  # The following example demonstrates how to change the order of
  # non-spacing accents,
  # <blockquote>
  # <pre>
  # // old rule
  # String oldRules = "=&#92;u0301;&#92;u0300;&#92;u0302;&#92;u0308"    // main accents
  #                 + ";&#92;u0327;&#92;u0303;&#92;u0304;&#92;u0305"    // main accents
  #                 + ";&#92;u0306;&#92;u0307;&#92;u0309;&#92;u030A"    // main accents
  #                 + ";&#92;u030B;&#92;u030C;&#92;u030D;&#92;u030E"    // main accents
  #                 + ";&#92;u030F;&#92;u0310;&#92;u0311;&#92;u0312"    // main accents
  #                 + "&lt; a , A ; ae, AE ; &#92;u00e6 , &#92;u00c6"
  #                 + "&lt; b , B &lt; c, C &lt; e, E & C &lt; d, D";
  # // change the order of accent characters
  # String addOn = "& &#92;u0300 ; &#92;u0308 ; &#92;u0302";
  # RuleBasedCollator myCollator = new RuleBasedCollator(oldRules + addOn);

    # IMPLEMENTATION NOTES:  The implementation of the collation algorithm is
    # divided across three classes: RuleBasedCollator, RBCollationTables, and
    # CollationElementIterator.  RuleBasedCollator contains the collator's
    # transient state and includes the code that uses the other classes to
    # implement comparison and sort-key building.  RuleBasedCollator also
    # contains the logic to handle French secondary accent sorting.
    # A RuleBasedCollator has two CollationElementIterators.  State doesn't
    # need to be preserved in these objects between calls to compare() or
    # getCollationKey(), but the objects persist anyway to avoid wasting extra
    # creation time.  compare() and getCollationKey() are synchronized to ensure
    # thread safety with this scheme.  The CollationElementIterator is responsible
    # for generating collation elements from strings and returning one element at
    # a time (sometimes there's a one-to-many or many-to-one mapping between
    # characters and collation elements-- this class handles that).
    # CollationElementIterator depends on RBCollationTables, which contains the
    # collator's static state.  RBCollationTables contains the actual data
    # tables specifying the collation order of characters for a particular locale
    # or use.  It also contains the base logic that CollationElementIterator
    # uses to map from characters to collation elements.  A single RBCollationTables
    # object is shared among all RuleBasedCollators for the same locale, and
    # thus by all the CollationElementIterators they create.
    # RuleBasedCollator constructor.  This takes the table rules and builds
    # a collation table out of them.  Please see RuleBasedCollator class
    # description for more details on the collation rule syntax.
    # @see java.util.Locale
    # @param rules the collation rules to build the collation table from.

    # will be thrown if the build process of the rules fails. For

        # Each collation element in a string has three components: primary (A vs B),
        # secondary (A vs A-acute), and tertiary (A' vs a); and a primary difference
        # at the end of a string takes precedence over a secondary or tertiary
        # difference earlier in the string.

        # To account for this, we put all of the primary orders at the beginning of the
        # string, followed by the secondary and tertiary orders, separated by nulls.

        # Here's a hypothetical example, with the collation element represented as
        # a three-digit number, one digit for primary, one for secondary, etc.

        # starting at the *end* of the string in languages with French secondary ordering.
