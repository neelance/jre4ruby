  # The <code>Collator</code> class performs locale-sensitive
  # <code>String</code> comparison. You use this class to build
  # searching and sorting routines for natural language text.
  # 
  # <p>
  # <code>Collator</code> is an abstract base class. Subclasses
  # implement specific collation strategies. One subclass,
  # <code>RuleBasedCollator</code>, is currently provided with
  # the Java Platform and is applicable to a wide set of languages. Other
  # subclasses may be created to handle more specialized needs.
  # 
  # <p>
  # Like other locale-sensitive classes, you can use the static
  # factory method, <code>getInstance</code>, to obtain the appropriate
  # <code>Collator</code> object for a given locale. You will only need
  # to look at the subclasses of <code>Collator</code> if you need
  # to understand the details of a particular collation strategy or
  # if you need to modify that strategy.
  # 
  # <p>
  # The following example shows how to compare two strings using
  # the <code>Collator</code> for the default locale.
  # <blockquote>
  # <pre>
  # // Compare two strings in the default locale
  # Collator myCollator = Collator.getInstance();
  # if( myCollator.compare("abc", "ABC") < 0 )
  # System.out.println("abc is less than ABC");
  # else
  # System.out.println("abc is greater than or equal to ABC");
  # </pre>
  # </blockquote>
  # 
  # <p>
  # You can set a <code>Collator</code>'s <em>strength</em> property
  # to determine the level of difference considered significant in
  # comparisons. Four strengths are provided: <code>PRIMARY</code>,
  # <code>SECONDARY</code>, <code>TERTIARY</code>, and <code>IDENTICAL</code>.
  # The exact assignment of strengths to language features is
  # locale dependant.  For example, in Czech, "e" and "f" are considered
  # primary differences, while "e" and "&#283;" are secondary differences,
  # "e" and "E" are tertiary differences and "e" and "e" are identical.
  # The following shows how both case and accents could be ignored for
  # US English.
  # <blockquote>
  # <pre>
  # //Get the Collator for US English and set its strength to PRIMARY
  # Collator usCollator = Collator.getInstance(Locale.US);
  # usCollator.setStrength(Collator.PRIMARY);
  # if( usCollator.compare("abc", "ABC") == 0 ) {
  # System.out.println("Strings are equivalent");
  # }
  # </pre>
  # </blockquote>
  # <p>
  # For comparing <code>String</code>s exactly once, the <code>compare</code>
  # method provides the best performance. When sorting a list of
  # <code>String</code>s however, it is generally necessary to compare each
  # <code>String</code> multiple times. In this case, <code>CollationKey</code>s
  # provide better performance. The <code>CollationKey</code> class converts
  # a <code>String</code> to a series of bits that can be compared bitwise
  # against other <code>CollationKey</code>s. A <code>CollationKey</code> is
  # created by a <code>Collator</code> object for a given <code>String</code>.
  # <br>
  # <strong>Note:</strong> <code>CollationKey</code>s from different
  # <code>Collator</code>s can not be compared. See the class description
  # for {@link CollationKey}
  # for an example using <code>CollationKey</code>s.
