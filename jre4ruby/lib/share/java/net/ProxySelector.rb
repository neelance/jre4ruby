  # Selects the proxy server to use, if any, when connecting to the
  # network resource referenced by a URL. A proxy selector is a
  # concrete sub-class of this class and is registered by invoking the
  # {@link java.net.ProxySelector#setDefault setDefault} method. The
  # currently registered proxy selector can be retrieved by calling
  # {@link java.net.ProxySelector#getDefault getDefault} method.
  # 
  # <p> When a proxy selector is registered, for instance, a subclass
  # of URLConnection class should call the {@link #select select}
  # method for each URL request so that the proxy selector can decide
  # if a direct, or proxied connection should be used. The {@link
  # #select select} method returns an iterator over a collection with
  # the preferred connection approach.
  # 
  # <p> If a connection cannot be established to a proxy (PROXY or
  # SOCKS) servers then the caller should call the proxy selector's
  # {@link #connectFailed connectFailed} method to notify the proxy
  # selector that the proxy server is unavailable. </p>
