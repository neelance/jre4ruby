  # This class defines the functionality of a certificate factory, which is
  # used to generate certificate, certification path (<code>CertPath</code>)
  # and certificate revocation list (CRL) objects from their encodings.
  # 
  # <p>For encodings consisting of multiple certificates, use
  # <code>generateCertificates</code> when you want to
  # parse a collection of possibly unrelated certificates. Otherwise,
  # use <code>generateCertPath</code> when you want to generate
  # a <code>CertPath</code> (a certificate chain) and subsequently
  # validate it with a <code>CertPathValidator</code>.
  # 
  # <p>A certificate factory for X.509 must return certificates that are an
  # instance of <code>java.security.cert.X509Certificate</code>, and CRLs
  # that are an instance of <code>java.security.cert.X509CRL</code>.
  # 
  # <p>The following example reads a file with Base64 encoded certificates,
  # which are each bounded at the beginning by -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----, and
  # bounded at the end by -----END CERTIFICATE-----. We convert the
  # <code>FileInputStream</code> (which does not support <code>mark</code>
  # and <code>reset</code>) to a <code>BufferedInputStream</code> (which
  # supports those methods), so that each call to
  # <code>generateCertificate</code> consumes only one certificate, and the
  # read position of the input stream is positioned to the next certificate in
  # the file:<p>
  # 
  # <pre>
  # FileInputStream fis = new FileInputStream(filename);
  # BufferedInputStream bis = new BufferedInputStream(fis);
  # 
  # CertificateFactory cf = CertificateFactory.getInstance("X.509");
  # 
  # while (bis.available() > 0) {
  # Certificate cert = cf.generateCertificate(bis);
  # System.out.println(cert.toString());
  # }
  # </pre>
  # 
  # <p>The following example parses a PKCS#7-formatted certificate reply stored
  # in a file and extracts all the certificates from it:<p>
  # 
  # <pre>
  # FileInputStream fis = new FileInputStream(filename);
  # CertificateFactory cf = CertificateFactory.getInstance("X.509");
  # Collection c = cf.generateCertificates(fis);
  # Iterator i = c.iterator();
  # while (i.hasNext()) {
  # Certificate cert = (Certificate)i.next();
  # System.out.println(cert);
  # }
  # </pre>
