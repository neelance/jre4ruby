  # A transparent stream that updates the associated message digest using
  # the bits going through the stream.
  # 
  # <p>To complete the message digest computation, call one of the
  # <code>digest</code> methods on the associated message
  # digest after your calls to one of this digest input stream's
  # {@link #read() read} methods.
  # 
  # <p>It is possible to turn this stream on or off (see
  # {@link #on(boolean) on}). When it is on, a call to one of the
  # <code>read</code> methods
  # results in an update on the message digest.  But when it is off,
  # the message digest is not updated. The default is for the stream
  # to be on.
  # 
  # <p>Note that digest objects can compute only one digest (see
  # {@link MessageDigest}),
  # so that in order to compute intermediate digests, a caller should
  # retain a handle onto the digest object, and clone it for each
  # digest to be computed, leaving the orginal digest untouched.
