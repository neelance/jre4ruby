  # A GuardedObject is an object that is used to protect access to
  # another object.
  # 
  # <p>A GuardedObject encapsulates a target object and a Guard object,
  # such that access to the target object is possible
  # only if the Guard object allows it.
  # Once an object is encapsulated by a GuardedObject,
  # access to that object is controlled by the <code>getObject</code>
  # method, which invokes the
  # <code>checkGuard</code> method on the Guard object that is
  # guarding access. If access is not allowed,
  # an exception is thrown.
