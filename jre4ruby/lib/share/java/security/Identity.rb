  # <p>This class represents identities: real-world objects such as people,
  # companies or organizations whose identities can be authenticated using
  # their public keys. Identities may also be more abstract (or concrete)
  # constructs, such as daemon threads or smart cards.
  # 
  # <p>All Identity objects have a name and a public key. Names are
  # immutable. Identities may also be scoped. That is, if an Identity is
  # specified to have a particular scope, then the name and public
  # key of the Identity are unique within that scope.
  # 
  # <p>An Identity also has a set of certificates (all certifying its own
  # public key). The Principal names specified in these certificates need
  # not be the same, only the key.
  # 
  # <p>An Identity can be subclassed, to include postal and email addresses,
  # telephone numbers, images of faces and logos, and so on.
