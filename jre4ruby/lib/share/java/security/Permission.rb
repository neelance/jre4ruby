  # Abstract class for representing access to a system resource.
  # All permissions have a name (whose interpretation depends on the subclass),
  # as well as abstract functions for defining the semantics of the
  # particular Permission subclass.
  # 
  # <p>Most Permission objects also include an "actions" list that tells the actions
  # that are permitted for the object.  For example,
  # for a <code>java.io.FilePermission</code> object, the permission name is
  # the pathname of a file (or directory), and the actions list
  # (such as "read, write") specifies which actions are granted for the
  # specified file (or for files in the specified directory).
  # The actions list is optional for Permission objects, such as
  # <code>java.lang.RuntimePermission</code>,
  # that don't need such a list; you either have the named permission (such
  # as "system.exit") or you don't.
  # 
  # <p>An important method that must be implemented by each subclass is
  # the <code>implies</code> method to compare Permissions. Basically,
  # "permission p1 implies permission p2" means that
  # if one is granted permission p1, one is naturally granted permission p2.
  # Thus, this is not an equality test, but rather more of a
  # subset test.
  # 
  # <P> Permission objects are similar to String objects in that they
  # are immutable once they have been created. Subclasses should not
  # provide methods that can change the state of a permission
  # once it has been created.
