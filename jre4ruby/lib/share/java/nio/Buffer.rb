  # A container for data of a specific primitive type.
  # 
  # <p> A buffer is a linear, finite sequence of elements of a specific
  # primitive type.  Aside from its content, the essential properties of a
  # buffer are its capacity, limit, and position: </p>
  # 
  # <blockquote>
  # 
  #   <p> A buffer's <i>capacity</i> is the number of elements it contains.  The
  #   capacity of a buffer is never negative and never changes.  </p>
  # 
  #   <p> A buffer's <i>limit</i> is the index of the first element that should
  #   not be read or written.  A buffer's limit is never negative and is never
  #   greater than its capacity.  </p>
  # 
  #   <p> A buffer's <i>position</i> is the index of the next element to be
  #   read or written.  A buffer's position is never negative and is never
  #   greater than its limit.  </p>
  # 
  # </blockquote>
  # 
  # <p> There is one subclass of this class for each non-boolean primitive type.
  # 
  # 
  # <h4> Transferring data </h4>
  # 
  # <p> Each subclass of this class defines two categories of <i>get</i> and
  # <i>put</i> operations: </p>
  # 
  # <blockquote>
  # 
  #   <p> <i>Relative</i> operations read or write one or more elements starting
  #   at the current position and then increment the position by the number of
  #   elements transferred.  If the requested transfer exceeds the limit then a
  #   relative <i>get</i> operation throws a {@link BufferUnderflowException}
  #   and a relative <i>put</i> operation throws a {@link
  #   BufferOverflowException}; in either case, no data is transferred.  </p>
  # 
  #   <p> <i>Absolute</i> operations take an explicit element index and do not
  #   affect the position.  Absolute <i>get</i> and <i>put</i> operations throw
  #   an {@link IndexOutOfBoundsException} if the index argument exceeds the
  #   limit.  </p>
  # 
  # </blockquote>
  # 
  # <p> Data may also, of course, be transferred in to or out of a buffer by the
  # I/O operations of an appropriate channel, which are always relative to the
  # current position.
  # 
  # 
  # <h4> Marking and resetting </h4>
  # 
  # <p> A buffer's <i>mark</i> is the index to which its position will be reset
  # when the {@link #reset reset} method is invoked.  The mark is not always
  # defined, but when it is defined it is never negative and is never greater
  # than the position.  If the mark is defined then it is discarded when the
  # position or the limit is adjusted to a value smaller than the mark.  If the
  # mark is not defined then invoking the {@link #reset reset} method causes an
  # {@link InvalidMarkException} to be thrown.
  # 
  # 
  # <h4> Invariants </h4>
  # 
  # <p> The following invariant holds for the mark, position, limit, and
  # capacity values:
  # 
  # <blockquote>
  #     <tt>0</tt> <tt>&lt;=</tt>
  #     <i>mark</i> <tt>&lt;=</tt>
  #     <i>position</i> <tt>&lt;=</tt>
  #     <i>limit</i> <tt>&lt;=</tt>
  #     <i>capacity</i>
  # </blockquote>
  # 
  # <p> A newly-created buffer always has a position of zero and a mark that is
  # undefined.  The initial limit may be zero, or it may be some other value
  # that depends upon the type of the buffer and the manner in which it is
  # constructed.  The initial content of a buffer is, in general, undefined.
  # 
  # 
  # <h4> Clearing, flipping, and rewinding </h4>
  # 
  # <p> In addition to methods for accessing the position, limit, and capacity
  # values and for marking and resetting, this class also defines the following
  # operations upon buffers:
  # 
  # <ul>
  # 
  #   <li><p> {@link #clear} makes a buffer ready for a new sequence of
  #   channel-read or relative <i>put</i> operations: It sets the limit to the
  #   capacity and the position to zero.  </p></li>
  # 
  #   <li><p> {@link #flip} makes a buffer ready for a new sequence of
  #   channel-write or relative <i>get</i> operations: It sets the limit to the
  #   current position and then sets the position to zero.  </p></li>
  # 
  #   <li><p> {@link #rewind} makes a buffer ready for re-reading the data that
  #   it already contains: It leaves the limit unchanged and sets the position
  #   to zero.  </p></li>
  # 
  # </ul>
  # 
  # 
  # <h4> Read-only buffers </h4>
  # 
  # <p> Every buffer is readable, but not every buffer is writable.  The
  # mutation methods of each buffer class are specified as <i>optional
  # operations</i> that will throw a {@link ReadOnlyBufferException} when
  # invoked upon a read-only buffer.  A read-only buffer does not allow its
  # content to be changed, but its mark, position, and limit values are mutable.
  # Whether or not a buffer is read-only may be determined by invoking its
  # {@link #isReadOnly isReadOnly} method.
  # 
  # 
  # <h4> Thread safety </h4>
  # 
  # <p> Buffers are not safe for use by multiple concurrent threads.  If a
  # buffer is to be used by more than one thread then access to the buffer
  # should be controlled by appropriate synchronization.
  # 
  # 
  # <h4> Invocation chaining </h4>
  # 
  # <p> Methods in this class that do not otherwise have a value to return are
  # specified to return the buffer upon which they are invoked.  This allows
  # method invocations to be chained; for example, the sequence of statements
  # 
  # <blockquote><pre>
  # b.flip();
  # b.position(23);
  # b.limit(42);</pre></blockquote>
  # 
  # can be replaced by the single, more compact statement
  # 
  # <blockquote><pre>
  # b.flip().position(23).limit(42);</pre></blockquote>
