  # A character buffer.
  # 
  # <p> This class defines four categories of operations upon
  # character buffers:
  # 
  # <ul>
  # 
  # <li><p> Absolute and relative {@link #get() </code><i>get</i><code>} and
  # {@link #put(char) </code><i>put</i><code>} methods that read and write
  # single characters; </p></li>
  # 
  # <li><p> Relative {@link #get(char[]) </code><i>bulk get</i><code>}
  # methods that transfer contiguous sequences of characters from this buffer
  # into an array; and</p></li>
  # 
  # <li><p> Relative {@link #put(char[]) </code><i>bulk put</i><code>}
  # methods that transfer contiguous sequences of characters from a
  # character array,&#32;a&#32;string, or some other character
  # buffer into this buffer;&#32;and </p></li>
  # 
  # 
  # 
  # 
  # 
  # 
  # 
  # 
  # 
  # 
  # 
  # 
  # 
  # 
  # <li><p> Methods for {@link #compact </code>compacting<code>}, {@link
  # #duplicate </code>duplicating<code>}, and {@link #slice
  # </code>slicing<code>} a character buffer.  </p></li>
  # 
  # </ul>
  # 
  # <p> Character buffers can be created either by {@link #allocate
  # </code><i>allocation</i><code>}, which allocates space for the buffer's
  # 
  # 
  # 
  # 
  # 
  # 
  # 
  # 
  # content, by {@link #wrap(char[]) </code><i>wrapping</i><code>} an existing
  # character array or&#32;string into a buffer, or by creating a
  # <a href="ByteBuffer.html#views"><i>view</i></a> of an existing byte buffer.

  # <p> Like a byte buffer, a character buffer is either <a
  # href="ByteBuffer.html#direct"><i>direct</i> or <i>non-direct</i></a>.  A
  # character buffer created via the <tt>wrap</tt> methods of this class will
  # be non-direct.  A character buffer created as a view of a byte buffer will
  # be direct if, and only if, the byte buffer itself is direct.  Whether or not
  # a character buffer is direct may be determined by invoking the {@link
  # #isDirect isDirect} method.  </p>
  # 
  # 
  # 
  # 
  # 
  # <p> This class implements the {@link CharSequence} interface so that
  # character buffers may be used wherever character sequences are accepted, for
  # example in the regular-expression package <tt>{@link java.util.regex}</tt>.
  # </p>
  # 
  # 
  # 
  # 
  # 
  # 
  # 
  # <p> Methods in this class that do not otherwise have a value to return are
  # specified to return the buffer upon which they are invoked.  This allows
  # method invocations to be chained.
  #

  # <blockquote><pre>
  # cb.put("text/");
  # cb.put(subtype);
