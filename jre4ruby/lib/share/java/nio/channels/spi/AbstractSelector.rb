  # Base implementation class for selectors.
  # 
  # <p> This class encapsulates the low-level machinery required to implement
  # the interruption of selection operations.  A concrete selector class must
  # invoke the {@link #begin begin} and {@link #end end} methods before and
  # after, respectively, invoking an I/O operation that might block
  # indefinitely.  In order to ensure that the {@link #end end} method is always
  # invoked, these methods should be used within a
  # <tt>try</tt>&nbsp;...&nbsp;<tt>finally</tt> block: <a name="be">
  # 
  # <blockquote><pre>
  # try {
  # begin();
  # // Perform blocking I/O operation here
  # ...
  # } finally {
  # end();
  # }</pre></blockquote>
  # 
  # <p> This class also defines methods for maintaining a selector's
  # cancelled-key set and for removing a key from its channel's key set, and
  # declares the abstract {@link #register register} method that is invoked by a
  # selectable channel's {@link AbstractSelectableChannel#register register}
  # method in order to perform the actual work of registering a channel.  </p>
