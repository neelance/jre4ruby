  # A direct byte buffer whose content is a memory-mapped region of a file.
  # 
  # <p> Mapped byte buffers are created via the {@link
  # java.nio.channels.FileChannel#map FileChannel.map} method.  This class
  # extends the {@link ByteBuffer} class with operations that are specific to
  # memory-mapped file regions.
  # 
  # <p> A mapped byte buffer and the file mapping that it represents remain
  # valid until the buffer itself is garbage-collected.
  # 
  # <p> The content of a mapped byte buffer can change at any time, for example
  # if the content of the corresponding region of the mapped file is changed by
  # this program or another.  Whether or not such changes occur, and when they
  # occur, is operating-system dependent and therefore unspecified.
  # 
  # <a name="inaccess"><p> All or part of a mapped byte buffer may become
  # inaccessible at any time, for example if the mapped file is truncated.  An
  # attempt to access an inaccessible region of a mapped byte buffer will not
  # change the buffer's content and will cause an unspecified exception to be
  # thrown either at the time of the access or at some later time.  It is
  # therefore strongly recommended that appropriate precautions be taken to
  # avoid the manipulation of a mapped file by this program, or by a
  # concurrently running program, except to read or write the file's content.
  # 
  # <p> Mapped byte buffers otherwise behave no differently than ordinary direct
  # byte buffers. </p>
