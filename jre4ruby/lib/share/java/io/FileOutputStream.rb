  # A file output stream is an output stream for writing data to a
  # <code>File</code> or to a <code>FileDescriptor</code>. Whether or not
  # a file is available or may be created depends upon the underlying
  # platform.  Some platforms, in particular, allow a file to be opened
  # for writing by only one <tt>FileOutputStream</tt> (or other
  # file-writing object) at a time.  In such situations the constructors in
  # this class will fail if the file involved is already open.
  # 
  # <p><code>FileOutputStream</code> is meant for writing streams of raw bytes
  # such as image data. For writing streams of characters, consider using
  # <code>FileWriter</code>.
