  # Signals that one of the ObjectStreamExceptions was thrown during a
  # write operation.  Thrown during a read operation when one of the
  # ObjectStreamExceptions was thrown during a write operation.  The
  # exception that terminated the write can be found in the detail
  # field. The stream is reset to it's initial state and all references
  # to objects already deserialized are discarded.

  # <p>As of release 1.4, this exception has been retrofitted to conform to
  # the general purpose exception-chaining mechanism.  The "exception causing
  # the abort" that is provided at construction time and
  # accessed via the public {@link #detail} field is now known as the
  # <i>cause</i>, and may be accessed via the {@link Throwable#getCause()}
  # method, as well as the aforementioned "legacy field."
