  # Exception indicating the failure of an object read operation due to
  # unread primitive data, or the end of data belonging to a serialized
  # object in the stream.  This exception may be thrown in two cases:
  # 
  # <ul>
  # <li>An attempt was made to read an object when the next element in the
  # stream is primitive data.  In this case, the OptionalDataException's
  # length field is set to the number of bytes of primitive data
  # immediately readable from the stream, and the eof field is set to
  # false.
  # 
  # <li>An attempt was made to read past the end of data consumable by a
  # class-defined readObject or readExternal method.  In this case, the
  # OptionalDataException's eof field is set to true, and the length field
  # is set to 0.
