  # A class used to represent multiprecision integers that makes efficient
  # use of allocated space by allowing a number to occupy only part of
  # an array so that the arrays do not have to be reallocated as often.
  # When performing an operation with many iterations the array used to
  # hold a number is only increased when necessary and does not have to
  # be the same size as the number it represents. A mutable number allows
  # calculations to occur on the same number without having to create
  # a new number for every step of the calculation as occurs with
  # BigIntegers.
  # 
  # Note that SignedMutableBigIntegers only support signed addition and
  # subtraction. All other operations occur as with MutableBigIntegers.
