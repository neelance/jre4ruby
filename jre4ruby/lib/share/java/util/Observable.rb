  # This class represents an observable object, or "data"
  # in the model-view paradigm. It can be subclassed to represent an
  # object that the application wants to have observed.
  # <p>
  # An observable object can have one or more observers. An observer
  # may be any object that implements interface <tt>Observer</tt>. After an
  # observable instance changes, an application calling the
  # <code>Observable</code>'s <code>notifyObservers</code> method
  # causes all of its observers to be notified of the change by a call
  # to their <code>update</code> method.
  # <p>
  # The order in which notifications will be delivered is unspecified.
  # The default implementation provided in the Observable class will
  # notify Observers in the order in which they registered interest, but
  # subclasses may change this order, use no guaranteed order, deliver
  # notifications on separate threads, or may guarantee that their
  # subclass follows this order, as they choose.
  # <p>
  # Note that this notification mechanism is has nothing to do with threads
  # and is completely separate from the <tt>wait</tt> and <tt>notify</tt>
  # mechanism of class <tt>Object</tt>.
  # <p>
  # When an observable object is newly created, its set of observers is
  # empty. Two observers are considered the same if and only if the
  # <tt>equals</tt> method returns true for them.
