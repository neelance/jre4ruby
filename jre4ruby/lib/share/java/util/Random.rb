  # An instance of this class is used to generate a stream of
  # pseudorandom numbers. The class uses a 48-bit seed, which is
  # modified using a linear congruential formula. (See Donald Knuth,
  # <i>The Art of Computer Programming, Volume 3</i>, Section 3.2.1.)
  # <p>
  # If two instances of {@code Random} are created with the same
  # seed, and the same sequence of method calls is made for each, they
  # will generate and return identical sequences of numbers. In order to
  # guarantee this property, particular algorithms are specified for the
  # class {@code Random}. Java implementations must use all the algorithms
  # shown here for the class {@code Random}, for the sake of absolute
  # portability of Java code. However, subclasses of class {@code Random}
  # are permitted to use other algorithms, so long as they adhere to the
  # general contracts for all the methods.
  # <p>
  # The algorithms implemented by class {@code Random} use a
  # {@code protected} utility method that on each invocation can supply
  # up to 32 pseudorandomly generated bits.
  # <p>
  # Many applications will find the method {@link Math#random} simpler to use.
