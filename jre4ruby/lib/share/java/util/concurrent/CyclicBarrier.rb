  # A synchronization aid that allows a set of threads to all wait for
  # each other to reach a common barrier point.  CyclicBarriers are
  # useful in programs involving a fixed sized party of threads that
  # must occasionally wait for each other. The barrier is called
  # <em>cyclic</em> because it can be re-used after the waiting threads
  # are released.
  # 
  # <p>A <tt>CyclicBarrier</tt> supports an optional {@link Runnable} command
  # that is run once per barrier point, after the last thread in the party
  # arrives, but before any threads are released.
  # This <em>barrier action</em> is useful
  # for updating shared-state before any of the parties continue.
  # 
  # <p><b>Sample usage:</b> Here is an example of
  # using a barrier in a parallel decomposition design:
  # <pre>
  # class Solver {
  # final int N;
  # final float[][] data;
  # final CyclicBarrier barrier;
  # 
  # class Worker implements Runnable {
  # int myRow;
  # Worker(int row) { myRow = row; }
  # public void run() {
  # while (!done()) {
  # processRow(myRow);
  # 
  # try {
  # barrier.await();
  # } catch (InterruptedException ex) {
  # return;
  # } catch (BrokenBarrierException ex) {
  # return;
  # }
  # }
  # }
  # }
  # 
  # public Solver(float[][] matrix) {
  # data = matrix;
  # N = matrix.length;
  # barrier = new CyclicBarrier(N,
  # new Runnable() {
  # public void run() {
  # mergeRows(...);
  # }
  # });
  # for (int i = 0; i < N; ++i)
  # new Thread(new Worker(i)).start();
  # 
  # waitUntilDone();
  # }
  # }
  # </pre>
  # Here, each worker thread processes a row of the matrix then waits at the
  # barrier until all rows have been processed. When all rows are processed
  # the supplied {@link Runnable} barrier action is executed and merges the
  # rows. If the merger
  # determines that a solution has been found then <tt>done()</tt> will return
  # <tt>true</tt> and each worker will terminate.
  # 
  # <p>If the barrier action does not rely on the parties being suspended when
  # it is executed, then any of the threads in the party could execute that
  # action when it is released. To facilitate this, each invocation of
  # {@link #await} returns the arrival index of that thread at the barrier.
  # You can then choose which thread should execute the barrier action, for
  # example:
  # <pre>  if (barrier.await() == 0) {
  # // log the completion of this iteration
  # }</pre>
  # 
  # <p>The <tt>CyclicBarrier</tt> uses an all-or-none breakage model
  # for failed synchronization attempts: If a thread leaves a barrier
  # point prematurely because of interruption, failure, or timeout, all
  # other threads waiting at that barrier point will also leave
  # abnormally via {@link BrokenBarrierException} (or
  # {@link InterruptedException} if they too were interrupted at about
  # the same time).
  # 
  # <p>Memory consistency effects: Actions in a thread prior to calling
  # {@code await()}
  # <a href="package-summary.html#MemoryVisibility"><i>happen-before</i></a>
  # actions that are part of the barrier action, which in turn
  # <i>happen-before</i> actions following a successful return from the
  # corresponding {@code await()} in other threads.
