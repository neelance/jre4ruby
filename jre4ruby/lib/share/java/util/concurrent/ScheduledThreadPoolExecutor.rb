  # A {@link ThreadPoolExecutor} that can additionally schedule
  # commands to run after a given delay, or to execute
  # periodically. This class is preferable to {@link java.util.Timer}
  # when multiple worker threads are needed, or when the additional
  # flexibility or capabilities of {@link ThreadPoolExecutor} (which
  # this class extends) are required.
  # 
  # <p> Delayed tasks execute no sooner than they are enabled, but
  # without any real-time guarantees about when, after they are
  # enabled, they will commence. Tasks scheduled for exactly the same
  # execution time are enabled in first-in-first-out (FIFO) order of
  # submission.
  # 
  # <p>While this class inherits from {@link ThreadPoolExecutor}, a few
  # of the inherited tuning methods are not useful for it. In
  # particular, because it acts as a fixed-sized pool using
  # {@code corePoolSize} threads and an unbounded queue, adjustments
  # to {@code maximumPoolSize} have no useful effect. Additionally, it
  # is almost never a good idea to set {@code corePoolSize} to zero or
  # use {@code allowCoreThreadTimeOut} because this may leave the pool
  # without threads to handle tasks once they become eligible to run.
  # 
  # <p><b>Extension notes:</b> This class overrides the
  # {@link ThreadPoolExecutor#execute execute} and
  # {@link AbstractExecutorService#submit(Runnable) submit}
  # methods to generate internal {@link ScheduledFuture} objects to
  # control per-task delays and scheduling.  To preserve
  # functionality, any further overrides of these methods in
  # subclasses must invoke superclass versions, which effectively
  # disables additional task customization.  However, this class
  # provides alternative protected extension method
  # {@code decorateTask} (one version each for {@code Runnable} and
  # {@code Callable}) that can be used to customize the concrete task
  # types used to execute commands entered via {@code execute},
  # {@code submit}, {@code schedule}, {@code scheduleAtFixedRate},
  # and {@code scheduleWithFixedDelay}.  By default, a
  # {@code ScheduledThreadPoolExecutor} uses a task type extending
  # {@link FutureTask}. However, this may be modified or replaced using
  # subclasses of the form:
  # 
  # <pre> {@code
  # public class CustomScheduledExecutor extends ScheduledThreadPoolExecutor {
  # 
  # static class CustomTask<V> implements RunnableScheduledFuture<V> { ... }
  # 
  # protected <V> RunnableScheduledFuture<V> decorateTask(
  # Runnable r, RunnableScheduledFuture<V> task) {
  # return new CustomTask<V>(r, task);
  # }
  # 
  # protected <V> RunnableScheduledFuture<V> decorateTask(
  # Callable<V> c, RunnableScheduledFuture<V> task) {
  # return new CustomTask<V>(c, task);
  # }
  # // ... add constructors, etc.

    }
    
    # This class specializes ThreadPoolExecutor implementation by
    # 
    # 1. Using a custom task type, ScheduledFutureTask for
    # tasks, even those that don't require scheduling (i.e.,
    # those submitted using ExecutorService execute, not
    # ScheduledExecutorService methods) which are treated as
    # delayed tasks with a delay of zero.
    # 
    # 2. Using a custom queue (DelayedWorkQueue) based on an
    # unbounded DelayQueue. The lack of capacity constraint and
    # the fact that corePoolSize and maximumPoolSize are
    # effectively identical simplifies some execution mechanics
    # (see delayedExecute) compared to ThreadPoolExecutor
    # version.
    # 
    # The DelayedWorkQueue class is defined below for the sake of
    # ensuring that all elements are instances of
    # RunnableScheduledFuture.  Since DelayQueue otherwise
    # requires type be Delayed, but not necessarily Runnable, and
    # the workQueue requires the opposite, we need to explicitly
    # define a class that requires both to ensure that users don't
    # add objects that aren't RunnableScheduledFutures via
    # getQueue().add() etc.
    # 
    # 3. Supporting optional run-after-shutdown parameters, which
    # leads to overrides of shutdown methods to remove and cancel
    # tasks that should NOT be run after shutdown, as well as
    # different recheck logic when task (re)submission overlaps
    # with a shutdown.
    # 
    # 4. Task decoration methods to allow interception and
    # instrumentation, which are needed because subclasses cannot
    # otherwise override submit methods to get this effect. These
    # don't have any impact on pool control logic though.
    # 
    # 
    # False if should cancel/suppress periodic tasks on shutdown.
