      # Wait queue node class.
      # 
      # <p>The wait queue is a variant of a "CLH" (Craig, Landin, and
      # Hagersten) lock queue. CLH locks are normally used for
      # spinlocks.  We instead use them for blocking synchronizers, but
      # use the same basic tactic of holding some of the control
      # information about a thread in the predecessor of its node.  A
      # "status" field in each node keeps track of whether a thread
      # should block.  A node is signalled when its predecessor
      # releases.  Each node of the queue otherwise serves as a
      # specific-notification-style monitor holding a single waiting
      # thread. The status field does NOT control whether threads are
      # granted locks etc though.  A thread may try to acquire if it is
      # first in the queue. But being first does not guarantee success;
      # it only gives the right to contend.  So the currently released
      # contender thread may need to rewait.
      # 
      # <p>To enqueue into a CLH lock, you atomically splice it in as new
      # tail. To dequeue, you just set the head field.
      # <pre>
      # +------+  prev +-----+       +-----+
      # head |      | <---- |     | <---- |     |  tail
      # +------+       +-----+       +-----+
      # </pre>
      # 
      # <p>Insertion into a CLH queue requires only a single atomic
      # operation on "tail", so there is a simple atomic point of
      # demarcation from unqueued to queued. Similarly, dequeing
      # involves only updating the "head". However, it takes a bit
      # more work for nodes to determine who their successors are,
      # in part to deal with possible cancellation due to timeouts
      # and interrupts.
      # 
      # <p>The "prev" links (not used in original CLH locks), are mainly
      # needed to handle cancellation. If a node is cancelled, its
      # successor is (normally) relinked to a non-cancelled
      # predecessor. For explanation of similar mechanics in the case
      # of spin locks, see the papers by Scott and Scherer at
      # http://www.cs.rochester.edu/u/scott/synchronization/
      # 
      # <p>We also use "next" links to implement blocking mechanics.
      # The thread id for each node is kept in its own node, so a
      # predecessor signals the next node to wake up by traversing
      # next link to determine which thread it is.  Determination of
      # successor must avoid races with newly queued nodes to set
      # the "next" fields of their predecessors.  This is solved
      # when necessary by checking backwards from the atomically
      # updated "tail" when a node's successor appears to be null.
      # (Or, said differently, the next-links are an optimization
      # so that we don't usually need a backward scan.)
      # 
      # <p>Cancellation introduces some conservatism to the basic
      # algorithms.  Since we must poll for cancellation of other
      # nodes, we can miss noticing whether a cancelled node is
      # ahead or behind us. This is dealt with by always unparking
      # successors upon cancellation, allowing them to stabilize on
      # a new predecessor, unless we can identify an uncancelled
      # predecessor who will carry this responsibility.
      # 
      # <p>CLH queues need a dummy header node to get started. But
      # we don't create them on construction, because it would be wasted
      # effort if there is never contention. Instead, the node
      # is constructed and head and tail pointers are set upon first
      # contention.
      # 
      # <p>Threads waiting on Conditions use the same nodes, but
      # use an additional link. Conditions only need to link nodes
      # in simple (non-concurrent) linked queues because they are
      # only accessed when exclusively held.  Upon await, a node is
      # inserted into a condition queue.  Upon signal, the node is
      # transferred to the main queue.  A special value of status
      # field is used to mark which queue a node is on.
      #

      # Scherer and Michael Scott, along with members of JSR-166
