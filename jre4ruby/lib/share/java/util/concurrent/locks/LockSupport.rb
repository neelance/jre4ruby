  # Basic thread blocking primitives for creating locks and other
  # synchronization classes.
  # 
  # <p>This class associates, with each thread that uses it, a permit
  # (in the sense of the {@link java.util.concurrent.Semaphore
  # Semaphore} class). A call to {@code park} will return immediately
  # if the permit is available, consuming it in the process; otherwise
  # it <em>may</em> block.  A call to {@code unpark} makes the permit
  # available, if it was not already available. (Unlike with Semaphores
  # though, permits do not accumulate. There is at most one.)
  # 
  # <p>Methods {@code park} and {@code unpark} provide efficient
  # means of blocking and unblocking threads that do not encounter the
  # problems that cause the deprecated methods {@code Thread.suspend}
  # and {@code Thread.resume} to be unusable for such purposes: Races
  # between one thread invoking {@code park} and another thread trying
  # to {@code unpark} it will preserve liveness, due to the
  # permit. Additionally, {@code park} will return if the caller's
  # thread was interrupted, and timeout versions are supported. The
  # {@code park} method may also return at any other time, for "no
  # reason", so in general must be invoked within a loop that rechecks
  # conditions upon return. In this sense {@code park} serves as an
  # optimization of a "busy wait" that does not waste as much time
  # spinning, but must be paired with an {@code unpark} to be
  # effective.
  # 
  # <p>The three forms of {@code park} each also support a
  # {@code blocker} object parameter. This object is recorded while
  # the thread is blocked to permit monitoring and diagnostic tools to
  # identify the reasons that threads are blocked. (Such tools may
  # access blockers using method {@link #getBlocker}.) The use of these
  # forms rather than the original forms without this parameter is
  # strongly encouraged. The normal argument to supply as a
  # {@code blocker} within a lock implementation is {@code this}.
  # 
  # <p>These methods are designed to be used as tools for creating
  # higher-level synchronization utilities, and are not in themselves
  # useful for most concurrency control applications.  The {@code park}
  # method is designed for use only in constructions of the form:
  # <pre>while (!canProceed()) { ... LockSupport.park(this); }</pre>
  # where neither {@code canProceed} nor any other actions prior to the
  # call to {@code park} entail locking or blocking.  Because only one
  # permit is associated with each thread, any intermediary uses of
  # {@code park} could interfere with its intended effects.
  # 
  # <p><b>Sample Usage.</b> Here is a sketch of a first-in-first-out
  # non-reentrant lock class:
  # <pre>{@code
  # class FIFOMutex {
  # private final AtomicBoolean locked = new AtomicBoolean(false);
  # private final Queue<Thread> waiters
  # = new ConcurrentLinkedQueue<Thread>();
  # 
  # public void lock() {
  # boolean wasInterrupted = false;
  # Thread current = Thread.currentThread();
  # waiters.add(current);
  # 
  # // Block while not first in queue or cannot acquire lock
  # while (waiters.peek() != current ||
  # !locked.compareAndSet(false, true)) {
  # LockSupport.park(this);
  # if (Thread.interrupted()) // ignore interrupts while waiting
  # wasInterrupted = true;
  # }
  # 
  # waiters.remove();
  # if (wasInterrupted)          // reassert interrupt status on exit
  # current.interrupt();
  # }
  # 
  # public void unlock() {
  # locked.set(false);
  # LockSupport.unpark(waiters.peek());
  # }
  # }}</pre>
