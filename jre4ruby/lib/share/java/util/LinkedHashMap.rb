  # <p>Hash table and linked list implementation of the <tt>Map</tt> interface,
  # with predictable iteration order.  This implementation differs from
  # <tt>HashMap</tt> in that it maintains a doubly-linked list running through
  # all of its entries.  This linked list defines the iteration ordering,
  # which is normally the order in which keys were inserted into the map
  # (<i>insertion-order</i>).  Note that insertion order is not affected
  # if a key is <i>re-inserted</i> into the map.  (A key <tt>k</tt> is
  # reinserted into a map <tt>m</tt> if <tt>m.put(k, v)</tt> is invoked when
  # <tt>m.containsKey(k)</tt> would return <tt>true</tt> immediately prior to
  # the invocation.)
  # 
  # <p>This implementation spares its clients from the unspecified, generally
  # chaotic ordering provided by {@link HashMap} (and {@link Hashtable}),
  # without incurring the increased cost associated with {@link TreeMap}.  It
  # can be used to produce a copy of a map that has the same order as the
  # original, regardless of the original map's implementation:
  # <pre>
  #     void foo(Map m) {
  #         Map copy = new LinkedHashMap(m);
  #         ...
  #     }
  # </pre>
  # This technique is particularly useful if a module takes a map on input,
  # copies it, and later returns results whose order is determined by that of
  # the copy.  (Clients generally appreciate having things returned in the same
  # order they were presented.)
  # 
  # <p>A special {@link #LinkedHashMap(int,float,boolean) constructor} is
  # provided to create a linked hash map whose order of iteration is the order
  # in which its entries were last accessed, from least-recently accessed to
  # most-recently (<i>access-order</i>).  This kind of map is well-suited to
  # building LRU caches.  Invoking the <tt>put</tt> or <tt>get</tt> method
  # results in an access to the corresponding entry (assuming it exists after
  # the invocation completes).  The <tt>putAll</tt> method generates one entry
  # access for each mapping in the specified map, in the order that key-value
  # mappings are provided by the specified map's entry set iterator.  <i>No
  # other methods generate entry accesses.</i> In particular, operations on
  # collection-views do <i>not</i> affect the order of iteration of the backing
  # map.
  # 
  # <p>The {@link #removeEldestEntry(Map.Entry)} method may be overridden to
  # impose a policy for removing stale mappings automatically when new mappings
  # are added to the map.
  # 
  # <p>This class provides all of the optional <tt>Map</tt> operations, and
  # permits null elements.  Like <tt>HashMap</tt>, it provides constant-time
  # performance for the basic operations (<tt>add</tt>, <tt>contains</tt> and
  # <tt>remove</tt>), assuming the hash function disperses elements
  # properly among the buckets.  Performance is likely to be just slightly
  # below that of <tt>HashMap</tt>, due to the added expense of maintaining the
  # linked list, with one exception: Iteration over the collection-views
  # of a <tt>LinkedHashMap</tt> requires time proportional to the <i>size</i>
  # of the map, regardless of its capacity.  Iteration over a <tt>HashMap</tt>
  # is likely to be more expensive, requiring time proportional to its
  # <i>capacity</i>.
  # 
  # <p>A linked hash map has two parameters that affect its performance:
  # <i>initial capacity</i> and <i>load factor</i>.  They are defined precisely
  # as for <tt>HashMap</tt>.  Note, however, that the penalty for choosing an
  # excessively high value for initial capacity is less severe for this class
  # than for <tt>HashMap</tt>, as iteration times for this class are unaffected
  # by capacity.
  # 
  # <p><strong>Note that this implementation is not synchronized.</strong>
  # If multiple threads access a linked hash map concurrently, and at least
  # one of the threads modifies the map structurally, it <em>must</em> be
  # synchronized externally.  This is typically accomplished by
  # synchronizing on some object that naturally encapsulates the map.
  # 
  # If no such object exists, the map should be "wrapped" using the
  # {@link Collections#synchronizedMap Collections.synchronizedMap}
  # method.  This is best done at creation time, to prevent accidental
  # unsynchronized access to the map:<pre>
  #   Map m = Collections.synchronizedMap(new LinkedHashMap(...));</pre>
  # 
  # A structural modification is any operation that adds or deletes one or more
  # mappings or, in the case of access-ordered linked hash maps, affects
  # iteration order.  In insertion-ordered linked hash maps, merely changing
  # the value associated with a key that is already contained in the map is not
  # a structural modification.  <strong>In access-ordered linked hash maps,
  # merely querying the map with <tt>get</tt> is a structural
  # modification.</strong>)
  # 
  # <p>The iterators returned by the <tt>iterator</tt> method of the collections
  # returned by all of this class's collection view methods are
  # <em>fail-fast</em>: if the map is structurally modified at any time after
  # the iterator is created, in any way except through the iterator's own
  # <tt>remove</tt> method, the iterator will throw a {@link
  # ConcurrentModificationException}.  Thus, in the face of concurrent
  # modification, the iterator fails quickly and cleanly, rather than risking
  # arbitrary, non-deterministic behavior at an undetermined time in the future.
  # 
  # <p>Note that the fail-fast behavior of an iterator cannot be guaranteed
  # as it is, generally speaking, impossible to make any hard guarantees in the
  # presence of unsynchronized concurrent modification.  Fail-fast iterators
  # throw <tt>ConcurrentModificationException</tt> on a best-effort basis.
  # Therefore, it would be wrong to write a program that depended on this
  # exception for its correctness:   <i>the fail-fast behavior of iterators
  # should be used only to detect bugs.</i>

    # Returns <tt>true</tt> if this map should remove its eldest entry.
    # This method is invoked by <tt>put</tt> and <tt>putAll</tt> after
    # inserting a new entry into the map.  It provides the implementor
    # with the opportunity to remove the eldest entry each time a new one
    # is added.  This is useful if the map represents a cache: it allows
    # the map to reduce memory consumption by deleting stale entries.
    # 
    # <p>Sample use: this override will allow the map to grow up to 100
    # entries and then delete the eldest entry each time a new entry is
    # added, maintaining a steady state of 100 entries.
    # <pre>
    #     private static final int MAX_ENTRIES = 100;

    # <p>This method typically does not modify the map in any way,
    # instead allowing the map to modify itself as directed by its
    # return value.  It <i>is</i> permitted for this method to modify
    # the map directly, but if it does so, it <i>must</i> return
    # <tt>false</tt> (indicating that the map should not attempt any
    # further modification).  The effects of returning <tt>true</tt>
    # after modifying the map from within this method are unspecified.
    # 
    # <p>This implementation merely returns <tt>false</tt> (so that this
    # map acts like a normal map - the eldest element is never removed).
    # 
    # @param    eldest The least recently inserted entry in the map, or if
    #           this is an access-ordered map, the least recently accessed
    #           entry.  This is the entry that will be removed it this
    #           method returns <tt>true</tt>.  If the map was empty prior
    #           to the <tt>put</tt> or <tt>putAll</tt> invocation resulting
    #           in this invocation, this will be the entry that was just
    #           inserted; in other words, if the map contains a single
    #           entry, the eldest entry is also the newest.
    # @return   <tt>true</tt> if the eldest entry should be removed
    #           from the map; <tt>false</tt> if it should be retained.
