  # These imports needed only as a workaround for a JavaDoc bug
  # 
  # This class provides a skeletal implementation of the {@link Preferences}
  # class, greatly easing the task of implementing it.
  # 
  # <p><strong>This class is for <tt>Preferences</tt> implementers only.
  # Normal users of the <tt>Preferences</tt> facility should have no need to
  # consult this documentation.  The {@link Preferences} documentation
  # should suffice.</strong>
  # 
  # <p>Implementors must override the nine abstract service-provider interface
  # (SPI) methods: {@link #getSpi(String)}, {@link #putSpi(String,String)},
  # {@link #removeSpi(String)}, {@link #childSpi(String)}, {@link
  # #removeNodeSpi()}, {@link #keysSpi()}, {@link #childrenNamesSpi()}, {@link
  # #syncSpi()} and {@link #flushSpi()}.  All of the concrete methods specify
  # precisely how they are implemented atop these SPI methods.  The implementor
  # may, at his discretion, override one or more of the concrete methods if the
  # default implementation is unsatisfactory for any reason, such as
  # performance.
  # 
  # <p>The SPI methods fall into three groups concerning exception
  # behavior. The <tt>getSpi</tt> method should never throw exceptions, but it
  # doesn't really matter, as any exception thrown by this method will be
  # intercepted by {@link #get(String,String)}, which will return the specified
  # default value to the caller.  The <tt>removeNodeSpi, keysSpi,
  # childrenNamesSpi, syncSpi</tt> and <tt>flushSpi</tt> methods are specified
  # to throw {@link BackingStoreException}, and the implementation is required
  # to throw this checked exception if it is unable to perform the operation.
  # The exception propagates outward, causing the corresponding API method
  # to fail.
  # 
  # <p>The remaining SPI methods {@link #putSpi(String,String)}, {@link
  # #removeSpi(String)} and {@link #childSpi(String)} have more complicated
  # exception behavior.  They are not specified to throw
  # <tt>BackingStoreException</tt>, as they can generally obey their contracts
  # even if the backing store is unavailable.  This is true because they return
  # no information and their effects are not required to become permanent until
  # a subsequent call to {@link Preferences#flush()} or
  # {@link Preferences#sync()}. Generally speaking, these SPI methods should not
  # throw exceptions.  In some implementations, there may be circumstances
  # under which these calls cannot even enqueue the requested operation for
  # later processing.  Even under these circumstances it is generally better to
  # simply ignore the invocation and return, rather than throwing an
  # exception.  Under these circumstances, however, all subsequent invocations
  # of <tt>flush()</tt> and <tt>sync</tt> should return <tt>false</tt>, as
  # returning <tt>true</tt> would imply that all previous operations had
  # successfully been made permanent.
  # 
  # <p>There is one circumstance under which <tt>putSpi, removeSpi and
  # childSpi</tt> <i>should</i> throw an exception: if the caller lacks
  # sufficient privileges on the underlying operating system to perform the
  # requested operation.  This will, for instance, occur on most systems
  # if a non-privileged user attempts to modify system preferences.
  # (The required privileges will vary from implementation to
  # implementation.  On some implementations, they are the right to modify the
  # contents of some directory in the file system; on others they are the right
  # to modify contents of some key in a registry.)  Under any of these
  # circumstances, it would generally be undesirable to let the program
  # continue executing as if these operations would become permanent at a later
  # time.  While implementations are not required to throw an exception under
  # these circumstances, they are encouraged to do so.  A {@link
  # SecurityException} would be appropriate.
  # 
  # <p>Most of the SPI methods require the implementation to read or write
  # information at a preferences node.  The implementor should beware of the
  # fact that another VM may have concurrently deleted this node from the
  # backing store.  It is the implementation's responsibility to recreate the
  # node if it has been deleted.
  # 
  # <p>Implementation note: In Sun's default <tt>Preferences</tt>
  # implementations, the user's identity is inherited from the underlying
  # operating system and does not change for the lifetime of the virtual
  # machine.  It is recognized that server-side <tt>Preferences</tt>
  # implementations may have the user identity change from request to request,
  # implicitly passed to <tt>Preferences</tt> methods via the use of a
  # static {@link ThreadLocal} instance.  Authors of such implementations are
  # <i>strongly</i> encouraged to determine the user at the time preferences
  # are accessed (for example by the {@link #get(String,String)} or {@link
  # #put(String,String)} method) rather than permanently associating a user
  # with each <tt>Preferences</tt> instance.  The latter behavior conflicts
  # with normal <tt>Preferences</tt> usage and would lead to great confusion.
