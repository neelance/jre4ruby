  # Resizable-array implementation of the {@link Deque} interface.  Array
  # deques have no capacity restrictions; they grow as necessary to support
  # usage.  They are not thread-safe; in the absence of external
  # synchronization, they do not support concurrent access by multiple threads.
  # Null elements are prohibited.  This class is likely to be faster than
  # {@link Stack} when used as a stack, and faster than {@link LinkedList}
  # when used as a queue.
  # 
  # <p>Most <tt>ArrayDeque</tt> operations run in amortized constant time.
  # Exceptions include {@link #remove(Object) remove}, {@link
  # #removeFirstOccurrence removeFirstOccurrence}, {@link #removeLastOccurrence
  # removeLastOccurrence}, {@link #contains contains}, {@link #iterator
  # iterator.remove()}, and the bulk operations, all of which run in linear
  # time.
  # 
  # <p>The iterators returned by this class's <tt>iterator</tt> method are
  # <i>fail-fast</i>: If the deque is modified at any time after the iterator
  # is created, in any way except through the iterator's own <tt>remove</tt>
  # method, the iterator will generally throw a {@link
  # ConcurrentModificationException}.  Thus, in the face of concurrent
  # modification, the iterator fails quickly and cleanly, rather than risking
  # arbitrary, non-deterministic behavior at an undetermined time in the
  # future.
  # 
  # <p>Note that the fail-fast behavior of an iterator cannot be guaranteed
  # as it is, generally speaking, impossible to make any hard guarantees in the
  # presence of unsynchronized concurrent modification.  Fail-fast iterators
  # throw <tt>ConcurrentModificationException</tt> on a best-effort basis.
  # Therefore, it would be wrong to write a program that depended on this
  # exception for its correctness: <i>the fail-fast behavior of iterators
  # should be used only to detect bugs.</i>
  # 
  # <p>This class and its iterator implement all of the
  # <em>optional</em> methods of the {@link Collection} and {@link
  # Iterator} interfaces.
  # 
  # <p>This class is a member of the
  # <a href="{@docRoot}/../technotes/guides/collections/index.html">
