  # A simple service-provider loading facility.
  # 
  # <p> A <i>service</i> is a well-known set of interfaces and (usually
  # abstract) classes.  A <i>service provider</i> is a specific implementation
  # of a service.  The classes in a provider typically implement the interfaces
  # and subclass the classes defined in the service itself.  Service providers
  # can be installed in an implementation of the Java platform in the form of
  # extensions, that is, jar files placed into any of the usual extension
  # directories.  Providers can also be made available by adding them to the
  # application's class path or by some other platform-specific means.
  # 
  # <p> For the purpose of loading, a service is represented by a single type,
  # that is, a single interface or abstract class.  (A concrete class can be
  # used, but this is not recommended.)  A provider of a given service contains
  # one or more concrete classes that extend this <i>service type</i> with data
  # and code specific to the provider.  The <i>provider class</i> is typically
  # not the entire provider itself but rather a proxy which contains enough
  # information to decide whether the provider is able to satisfy a particular
  # request together with code that can create the actual provider on demand.
  # The details of provider classes tend to be highly service-specific; no
  # single class or interface could possibly unify them, so no such type is
  # defined here.  The only requirement enforced by this facility is that
  # provider classes must have a zero-argument constructor so that they can be
  # instantiated during loading.
  # 
  # <p><a name="format"> A service provider is identified by placing a
  # <i>provider-configuration file</i> in the resource directory
  # <tt>META-INF/services</tt>.  The file's name is the fully-qualified <a
  # href="../lang/ClassLoader.html#name">binary name</a> of the service's type.
  # The file contains a list of fully-qualified binary names of concrete
  # provider classes, one per line.  Space and tab characters surrounding each
  # name, as well as blank lines, are ignored.  The comment character is
  # <tt>'#'</tt> (<tt>'&#92;u0023'</tt>, <font size="-1">NUMBER SIGN</font>); on
  # each line all characters following the first comment character are ignored.
  # The file must be encoded in UTF-8.
  # 
  # <p> If a particular concrete provider class is named in more than one
  # configuration file, or is named in the same configuration file more than
  # once, then the duplicates are ignored.  The configuration file naming a
  # particular provider need not be in the same jar file or other distribution
  # unit as the provider itself.  The provider must be accessible from the same
  # class loader that was initially queried to locate the configuration file;
  # note that this is not necessarily the class loader from which the file was
  # actually loaded.
  # 
  # <p> Providers are located and instantiated lazily, that is, on demand.  A
  # service loader maintains a cache of the providers that have been loaded so
  # far.  Each invocation of the {@link #iterator iterator} method returns an
  # iterator that first yields all of the elements of the cache, in
  # instantiation order, and then lazily locates and instantiates any remaining
  # providers, adding each one to the cache in turn.  The cache can be cleared
  # via the {@link #reload reload} method.
  # 
  # <p> Service loaders always execute in the security context of the caller.
  # Trusted system code should typically invoke the methods in this class, and
  # the methods of the iterators which they return, from within a privileged
  # security context.
  # 
  # <p> Instances of this class are not safe for use by multiple concurrent
  # threads.
  # 
  # <p> Unless otherwise specified, passing a <tt>null</tt> argument to any
  # method in this class will cause a {@link NullPointerException} to be thrown.
  # 
  # 
  # <p><span style="font-weight: bold; padding-right: 1em">Example</span>
  # Suppose we have a service type <tt>com.example.CodecSet</tt> which is
  # intended to represent sets of encoder/decoder pairs for some protocol.  In
  # this case it is an abstract class with two abstract methods:
  # 
  # <blockquote><pre>
  # public abstract Encoder getEncoder(String encodingName);
  # public abstract Decoder getDecoder(String encodingName);</pre></blockquote>
  # 
  # Each method returns an appropriate object or <tt>null</tt> if the provider
  # does not support the given encoding.  Typical providers support more than
  # one encoding.
  # 
  # <p> If <tt>com.example.impl.StandardCodecs</tt> is an implementation of the
  # <tt>CodecSet</tt> service then its jar file also contains a file named
  # 
  # <blockquote><pre>
  # META-INF/services/com.example.CodecSet</pre></blockquote>
  # 
  # <p> This file contains the single line:
  # 
  # <blockquote><pre>
  # com.example.impl.StandardCodecs    # Standard codecs</pre></blockquote>
  # 
  # <p> The <tt>CodecSet</tt> class creates and saves a single service instance
  # at initialization:
  # 
  # <blockquote><pre>
  # private static ServiceLoader&lt;CodecSet&gt; codecSetLoader
  # = ServiceLoader.load(CodecSet.class);</pre></blockquote>
  # 
  # <p> To locate an encoder for a given encoding name it defines a static
  # factory method which iterates through the known and available providers,
  # returning only when it has located a suitable encoder or has run out of
  # providers.
  # 
  # <blockquote><pre>
  # public static Encoder getEncoder(String encodingName) {
  # for (CodecSet cp : codecSetLoader) {
  # Encoder enc = cp.getEncoder(encodingName);
  # if (enc != null)
  # return enc;
  # }
  # return null;
  # }</pre></blockquote>
  # 
  # <p> A <tt>getDecoder</tt> method is defined similarly.
  # 
  # 
  # <p><span style="font-weight: bold; padding-right: 1em">Usage Note</span> If
  # the class path of a class loader that is used for provider loading includes
  # remote network URLs then those URLs will be dereferenced in the process of
  # searching for provider-configuration files.
  # 
  # <p> This activity is normal, although it may cause puzzling entries to be
  # created in web-server logs.  If a web server is not configured correctly,
  # however, then this activity may cause the provider-loading algorithm to fail
  # spuriously.
  # 
  # <p> A web server should return an HTTP 404 (Not Found) response when a
  # requested resource does not exist.  Sometimes, however, web servers are
  # erroneously configured to return an HTTP 200 (OK) response along with a
  # helpful HTML error page in such cases.  This will cause a {@link
  # ServiceConfigurationError} to be thrown when this class attempts to parse
  # the HTML page as a provider-configuration file.  The best solution to this
  # problem is to fix the misconfigured web server to return the correct
  # response code (HTTP 404) along with the HTML error page.
