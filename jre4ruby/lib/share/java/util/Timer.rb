  # A facility for threads to schedule tasks for future execution in a
  # background thread.  Tasks may be scheduled for one-time execution, or for
  # repeated execution at regular intervals.
  # 
  # <p>Corresponding to each <tt>Timer</tt> object is a single background
  # thread that is used to execute all of the timer's tasks, sequentially.
  # Timer tasks should complete quickly.  If a timer task takes excessive time
  # to complete, it "hogs" the timer's task execution thread.  This can, in
  # turn, delay the execution of subsequent tasks, which may "bunch up" and
  # execute in rapid succession when (and if) the offending task finally
  # completes.
  # 
  # <p>After the last live reference to a <tt>Timer</tt> object goes away
  # <i>and</i> all outstanding tasks have completed execution, the timer's task
  # execution thread terminates gracefully (and becomes subject to garbage
  # collection).  However, this can take arbitrarily long to occur.  By
  # default, the task execution thread does not run as a <i>daemon thread</i>,
  # so it is capable of keeping an application from terminating.  If a caller
  # wants to terminate a timer's task execution thread rapidly, the caller
  # should invoke the timer's <tt>cancel</tt> method.
  # 
  # <p>If the timer's task execution thread terminates unexpectedly, for
  # example, because its <tt>stop</tt> method is invoked, any further
  # attempt to schedule a task on the timer will result in an
  # <tt>IllegalStateException</tt>, as if the timer's <tt>cancel</tt>
  # method had been invoked.
  # 
  # <p>This class is thread-safe: multiple threads can share a single
  # <tt>Timer</tt> object without the need for external synchronization.
  # 
  # <p>This class does <i>not</i> offer real-time guarantees: it schedules
  # tasks using the <tt>Object.wait(long)</tt> method.
  # 
  # <p>Java 5.0 introduced the {@code java.util.concurrent} package and
  # one of the concurrency utilities therein is the {@link
  # java.util.concurrent.ScheduledThreadPoolExecutor
  # ScheduledThreadPoolExecutor} which is a thread pool for repeatedly
  # executing tasks at a given rate or delay.  It is effectively a more
  # versatile replacement for the {@code Timer}/{@code TimerTask}
  # combination, as it allows multiple service threads, accepts various
  # time units, and doesn't require subclassing {@code TimerTask} (just
  # implement {@code Runnable}).  Configuring {@code
  # ScheduledThreadPoolExecutor} with one thread makes it equivalent to
  # {@code Timer}.
  # 
  # <p>Implementation note: This class scales to large numbers of concurrently
  # scheduled tasks (thousands should present no problem).  Internally,
  # it uses a binary heap to represent its task queue, so the cost to schedule
  # a task is O(log n), where n is the number of concurrently scheduled tasks.
  # 
  # <p>Implementation note: All constructors start a timer thread.
