  # An engine that performs match operations on a {@link java.lang.CharSequence
  # </code>character sequence<code>} by interpreting a {@link Pattern}.
  # 
  # <p> A matcher is created from a pattern by invoking the pattern's {@link
  # Pattern#matcher matcher} method.  Once created, a matcher can be used to
  # perform three different kinds of match operations:
  # 
  # <ul>
  # 
  # <li><p> The {@link #matches matches} method attempts to match the entire
  # input sequence against the pattern.  </p></li>
  # 
  # <li><p> The {@link #lookingAt lookingAt} method attempts to match the
  # input sequence, starting at the beginning, against the pattern.  </p></li>
  # 
  # <li><p> The {@link #find find} method scans the input sequence looking for
  # the next subsequence that matches the pattern.  </p></li>
  # 
  # </ul>
  # 
  # <p> Each of these methods returns a boolean indicating success or failure.
  # More information about a successful match can be obtained by querying the
  # state of the matcher.
  # 
  # <p> A matcher finds matches in a subset of its input called the
  # <i>region</i>. By default, the region contains all of the matcher's input.
  # The region can be modified via the{@link #region region} method and queried
  # via the {@link #regionStart regionStart} and {@link #regionEnd regionEnd}
  # methods. The way that the region boundaries interact with some pattern
  # constructs can be changed. See {@link #useAnchoringBounds
  # useAnchoringBounds} and {@link #useTransparentBounds useTransparentBounds}
  # for more details.
  # 
  # <p> This class also defines methods for replacing matched subsequences with
  # new strings whose contents can, if desired, be computed from the match
  # result.  The {@link #appendReplacement appendReplacement} and {@link
  # #appendTail appendTail} methods can be used in tandem in order to collect
  # the result into an existing string buffer, or the more convenient {@link
  # #replaceAll replaceAll} method can be used to create a string in which every
  # matching subsequence in the input sequence is replaced.
  # 
  # <p> The explicit state of a matcher includes the start and end indices of
  # the most recent successful match.  It also includes the start and end
  # indices of the input subsequence captured by each <a
  # href="Pattern.html#cg">capturing group</a> in the pattern as well as a total
  # count of such subsequences.  As a convenience, methods are also provided for
  # returning these captured subsequences in string form.
  # 
  # <p> The explicit state of a matcher is initially undefined; attempting to
  # query any part of it before a successful match will cause an {@link
  # IllegalStateException} to be thrown.  The explicit state of a matcher is
  # recomputed by every match operation.
  # 
  # <p> The implicit state of a matcher includes the input character sequence as
  # well as the <i>append position</i>, which is initially zero and is updated
  # by the {@link #appendReplacement appendReplacement} method.
  # 
  # <p> A matcher may be reset explicitly by invoking its {@link #reset()}
  # method or, if a new input sequence is desired, its {@link
  # #reset(java.lang.CharSequence) reset(CharSequence)} method.  Resetting a
  # matcher discards its explicit state information and sets the append position
  # to zero.
  # 
  # <p> Instances of this class are not safe for use by multiple concurrent
  # threads. </p>

    # <ol>
    # 
    # <li><p> It reads characters from the input sequence, starting at the
    # append position, and appends them to the given string buffer.  It
    # stops after reading the last character preceding the previous match,
    # that is, the character at index {@link
    # #start()}&nbsp;<tt>-</tt>&nbsp;<tt>1</tt>.  </p></li>
    # 
    # <li><p> It appends the given replacement string to the string buffer.
    # </p></li>
    # 
    # <li><p> It sets the append position of this matcher to the index of
    # the last character matched, plus one, that is, to {@link #end()}.
    # </p></li>
    # 
    # </ol>
    # 
    # <p> The replacement string may contain references to subsequences
    # captured during the previous match: Each occurrence of
    # <tt>$</tt><i>g</i><tt></tt> will be replaced by the result of
    # evaluating {@link #group(int) group}<tt>(</tt><i>g</i><tt>)</tt>.
    # The first number after the <tt>$</tt> is always treated as part of
    # the group reference. Subsequent numbers are incorporated into g if
    # they would form a legal group reference. Only the numerals '0'
    # through '9' are considered as potential components of the group
    # reference. If the second group matched the string <tt>"foo"</tt>, for
    # example, then passing the replacement string <tt>"$2bar"</tt> would
    # cause <tt>"foobar"</tt> to be appended to the string buffer. A dollar
    # sign (<tt>$</tt>) may be included as a literal in the replacement
    # string by preceding it with a backslash (<tt>\$</tt>).
    # 
    # <p> Note that backslashes (<tt>\</tt>) and dollar signs (<tt>$</tt>) in
    # the replacement string may cause the results to be different than if it
    # were being treated as a literal replacement string. Dollar signs may be
