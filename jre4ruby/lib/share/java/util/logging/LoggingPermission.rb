  # The permission which the SecurityManager will check when code
  # that is running with a SecurityManager calls one of the logging
  # control methods (such as Logger.setLevel).
  # <p>
  # Currently there is only one named LoggingPermission.  This is "control"
  # and it grants the ability to control the logging configuration, for
  # example by adding or removing Handlers, by adding or removing Filters,
  # or by changing logging levels.
  # <p>
  # Programmers do not normally create LoggingPermission objects directly.
  # Instead they are created by the security policy code based on reading
  # the security policy file.
