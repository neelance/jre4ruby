  # <code>PropertyResourceBundle</code> is a concrete subclass of
  # <code>ResourceBundle</code> that manages resources for a locale
  # using a set of static strings from a property file. See
  # {@link ResourceBundle ResourceBundle} for more information about resource
  # bundles.
  # 
  # <p>
  # Unlike other types of resource bundle, you don't subclass
  # <code>PropertyResourceBundle</code>.  Instead, you supply properties
  # files containing the resource data.  <code>ResourceBundle.getBundle</code>
  # will automatically look for the appropriate properties file and create a
  # <code>PropertyResourceBundle</code> that refers to it. See
  # {@link ResourceBundle#getBundle(java.lang.String, java.util.Locale, java.lang.ClassLoader) ResourceBundle.getBundle}
  # for a complete description of the search and instantiation strategy.
  # 
  # <p>
  # The following <a name="sample">example</a> shows a member of a resource
  # bundle family with the base name "MyResources".
  # The text defines the bundle "MyResources_de",
  # the German member of the bundle family.
  # This member is based on <code>PropertyResourceBundle</code>, and the text
  # therefore is the content of the file "MyResources_de.properties"
  # (a related <a href="ListResourceBundle.html#sample">example</a> shows
  # how you can add bundles to this family that are implemented as subclasses
  # of <code>ListResourceBundle</code>).
  # The keys in this example are of the form "s1" etc. The actual
  # keys are entirely up to your choice, so long as they are the same as
  # the keys you use in your program to retrieve the objects from the bundle.
  # Keys are case-sensitive.
  # <blockquote>
  # <pre>
  # # MessageFormat pattern
  # s1=Die Platte \"{1}\" enth&auml;lt {0}.
  # 
  # # location of {0} in pattern
  # s2=1
  # 
  # # sample disk name
  # s3=Meine Platte
  # 
  # # first ChoiceFormat choice
  # s4=keine Dateien
  # 
  # # second ChoiceFormat choice
  # s5=eine Datei
  # 
  # # third ChoiceFormat choice
  # s6={0,number} Dateien

  # # sample date

  # <p>
  # <strong>Note:</strong> PropertyResourceBundle can be constructed either
  # from an InputStream or a Reader, which represents a property file.
  # Constructing a PropertyResourceBundle instance from an InputStream requires
  # that the input stream be encoded in ISO-8859-1.  In that case, characters
  # that cannot be represented in ISO-8859-1 encoding must be represented by
  # <a href="http://java.sun.com/docs/books/jls/third_edition/html/lexical.html#3.3">Unicode Escapes</a>,
  # whereas the other constructor which takes a Reader does not have that limitation.
