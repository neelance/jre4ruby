  # An unbounded priority {@linkplain Queue queue} based on a priority heap.
  # The elements of the priority queue are ordered according to their
  # {@linkplain Comparable natural ordering}, or by a {@link Comparator}
  # provided at queue construction time, depending on which constructor is
  # used.  A priority queue does not permit {@code null} elements.
  # A priority queue relying on natural ordering also does not permit
  # insertion of non-comparable objects (doing so may result in
  # {@code ClassCastException}).
  # 
  # <p>The <em>head</em> of this queue is the <em>least</em> element
  # with respect to the specified ordering.  If multiple elements are
  # tied for least value, the head is one of those elements -- ties are
  # broken arbitrarily.  The queue retrieval operations {@code poll},
  # {@code remove}, {@code peek}, and {@code element} access the
  # element at the head of the queue.
  # 
  # <p>A priority queue is unbounded, but has an internal
  # <i>capacity</i> governing the size of an array used to store the
  # elements on the queue.  It is always at least as large as the queue
  # size.  As elements are added to a priority queue, its capacity
  # grows automatically.  The details of the growth policy are not
  # specified.
  # 
  # <p>This class and its iterator implement all of the
  # <em>optional</em> methods of the {@link Collection} and {@link
  # Iterator} interfaces.  The Iterator provided in method {@link
  # #iterator()} is <em>not</em> guaranteed to traverse the elements of
  # the priority queue in any particular order. If you need ordered
  # traversal, consider using {@code Arrays.sort(pq.toArray())}.
  # 
  # <p> <strong>Note that this implementation is not synchronized.</strong>
  # Multiple threads should not access a {@code PriorityQueue}
  # instance concurrently if any of the threads modifies the queue.
  # Instead, use the thread-safe {@link
  # java.util.concurrent.PriorityBlockingQueue} class.
  # 
  # <p>Implementation note: this implementation provides
  # O(log(n)) time for the enqueing and dequeing methods
  # ({@code offer}, {@code poll}, {@code remove()} and {@code add});
  # linear time for the {@code remove(Object)} and {@code contains(Object)}
  # methods; and constant time for the retrieval methods
  # ({@code peek}, {@code element}, and {@code size}).
  #
