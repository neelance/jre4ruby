  # The management interface for the class loading system of

  # 
  # <p> A Java virtual machine has a single instance of the implementation
  # class of this interface.  This instance implementing this interface is
  # an <a href="ManagementFactory.html#MXBean">MXBean</a>
  # that can be obtained by calling
  # the {@link ManagementFactory#getClassLoadingMXBean} method or
  # from the {@link ManagementFactory#getPlatformMBeanServer
  # platform <tt>MBeanServer</tt>} method.
  # 
  # <p>The <tt>ObjectName</tt> for uniquely identifying the MXBean for
  # the class loading system within an <tt>MBeanServer</tt> is:
  # <blockquote>
  # {@link ManagementFactory#CLASS_LOADING_MXBEAN_NAME
  # <tt>java.lang:type=ClassLoading</tt>}
