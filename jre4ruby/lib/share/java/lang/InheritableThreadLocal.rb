  # This class extends <tt>ThreadLocal</tt> to provide inheritance of values
  # from parent thread to child thread: when a child thread is created, the
  # child receives initial values for all inheritable thread-local variables
  # for which the parent has values.  Normally the child's values will be
  # identical to the parent's; however, the child's value can be made an
  # arbitrary function of the parent's by overriding the <tt>childValue</tt>
  # method in this class.
  # 
  # <p>Inheritable thread-local variables are used in preference to
  # ordinary thread-local variables when the per-thread-attribute being
  # maintained in the variable (e.g., User ID, Transaction ID) must be
  # automatically transmitted to any child threads that are created.
