  # This class is used to create operating system processes.
  # 
  # <p>Each <code>ProcessBuilder</code> instance manages a collection
  # of process attributes.  The {@link #start()} method creates a new
  # {@link Process} instance with those attributes.  The {@link
  # #start()} method can be invoked repeatedly from the same instance
  # to create new subprocesses with identical or related attributes.
  # 
  # <p>Each process builder manages these process attributes:
  # 
  # <ul>
  # 
  # <li>a <i>command</i>, a list of strings which signifies the
  # external program file to be invoked and its arguments, if any.
  # Which string lists represent a valid operating system command is
  # system-dependent.  For example, it is common for each conceptual
  # argument to be an element in this list, but there are operating
  # systems where programs are expected to tokenize command line
  # strings themselves - on such a system a Java implementation might
  # require commands to contain exactly two elements.
  # 
  # <li>an <i>environment</i>, which is a system-dependent mapping from
  # <i>variables</i> to <i>values</i>.  The initial value is a copy of
  # the environment of the current process (see {@link System#getenv()}).
  # 
  # <li>a <i>working directory</i>.  The default value is the current
  # working directory of the current process, usually the directory
  # named by the system property <code>user.dir</code>.
  # 
  # <li>a <i>redirectErrorStream</i> property.  Initially, this property
  # is <code>false</code>, meaning that the standard output and error
  # output of a subprocess are sent to two separate streams, which can
  # be accessed using the {@link Process#getInputStream()} and {@link
  # Process#getErrorStream()} methods.  If the value is set to
  # <code>true</code>, the standard error is merged with the standard
  # output.  This makes it easier to correlate error messages with the
  # corresponding output.  In this case, the merged data can be read
  # from the stream returned by {@link Process#getInputStream()}, while
  # reading from the stream returned by {@link
  # Process#getErrorStream()} will get an immediate end of file.
  # 
  # </ul>
  # 
  # <p>Modifying a process builder's attributes will affect processes
  # subsequently started by that object's {@link #start()} method, but
  # will never affect previously started processes or the Java process
  # itself.
  # 
  # <p>Most error checking is performed by the {@link #start()} method.
  # It is possible to modify the state of an object so that {@link
  # #start()} will fail.  For example, setting the command attribute to
  # an empty list will not throw an exception unless {@link #start()}
  # is invoked.
  # 
  # <p><strong>Note that this class is not synchronized.</strong>
  # If multiple threads access a <code>ProcessBuilder</code> instance
  # concurrently, and at least one of the threads modifies one of the
  # attributes structurally, it <i>must</i> be synchronized externally.
  # 
  # <p>Starting a new process which uses the default working directory
  # and environment is easy:
  # 
  # <blockquote><pre>
  # Process p = new ProcessBuilder("myCommand", "myArg").start();
  # </pre></blockquote>
  # 
  # <p>Here is an example that starts a process with a modified working
  # directory and environment:
  # 
  # <blockquote><pre>
  # ProcessBuilder pb = new ProcessBuilder("myCommand", "myArg1", "myArg2");
  # Map&lt;String, String&gt; env = pb.environment();
  # env.put("VAR1", "myValue");
  # env.remove("OTHERVAR");
  # env.put("VAR2", env.get("VAR1") + "suffix");
  # pb.directory(new File("myDir"));
  # Process p = pb.start();
  # </pre></blockquote>
  # 
  # <p>To start a process with an explicit set of environment
  # variables, first call {@link java.util.Map#clear() Map.clear()}
  # before adding environment variables.

    # this object's {@link #start()} method will use this map as
    # their environment.
    # 
    # <p>The returned object may be modified using ordinary {@link
    # java.util.Map Map} operations.  These modifications will be
    # visible to subprocesses started via the {@link #start()}
    # method.  Two <code>ProcessBuilder</code> instances always
    # contain independent process environments, so changes to the
    # returned map will never be reflected in any other
    # <code>ProcessBuilder</code> instance or the values returned by
    # {@link System#getenv System.getenv}.
    # 
    # <p>If the system does not support environment variables, an
    # empty map is returned.
    # 
    # <p>The returned map does not permit null keys or values.
    # Attempting to insert or query the presence of a null key or
    # value will throw a {@link NullPointerException}.
    # Attempting to query the presence of a key or value which is not
    # of type {@link String} will throw a {@link ClassCastException}.
    # 
    # <p>The behavior of the returned map is system-dependent.  A
    # system may not allow modifications to environment variables or
    # may forbid certain variable names or values.  For this reason,
    # attempts to modify the map may fail with
    # {@link UnsupportedOperationException} or
    # {@link IllegalArgumentException}
    # if the modification is not permitted by the operating system.
    # 
    # <p>Since the external format of environment variable names and
    # values is system-dependent, there may not be a one-to-one
    # mapping between them and Java's Unicode strings.  Nevertheless,
    # the map is implemented in such a way that environment variables
    # which are not modified by Java code will have an unmodified
    # native representation in the subprocess.

    # general contract of the {@link Object#equals} and
