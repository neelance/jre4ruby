  # This class provides thread-local variables.  These variables differ from
  # their normal counterparts in that each thread that accesses one (via its
  # <tt>get</tt> or <tt>set</tt> method) has its own, independently initialized
  # copy of the variable.  <tt>ThreadLocal</tt> instances are typically private
  # static fields in classes that wish to associate state with a thread (e.g.,
  # a user ID or Transaction ID).
  # 
  # <p>For example, the class below generates unique identifiers local to each
  # thread.
  # A thread's id is assigned the first time it invokes <tt>ThreadId.get()</tt>
  # and remains unchanged on subsequent calls.
  # <pre>

  # new ThreadLocal&lt;Integer>() {
  # &#64;Override protected Integer initialValue() {

  # }
  # };
  # 
  # // Returns the current thread's unique ID, assigning it if necessary
  # public static int get() {
  # return threadId.get();
  # }
  # }
  # </pre>
  # <p>Each thread holds an implicit reference to its copy of a thread-local
  # variable as long as the thread is alive and the <tt>ThreadLocal</tt>
  # instance is accessible; after a thread goes away, all of its copies of
  # thread-local instances are subject to garbage collection (unless other
  # references to these copies exist).
