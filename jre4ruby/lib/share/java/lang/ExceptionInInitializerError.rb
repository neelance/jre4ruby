  # Signals that an unexpected exception has occurred in a static initializer.
  # An <code>ExceptionInInitializerError</code> is thrown to indicate that an
  # exception occurred during evaluation of a static initializer or the
  # initializer for a static variable.
  # 
  # <p>As of release 1.4, this exception has been retrofitted to conform to
  # the general purpose exception-chaining mechanism.  The "saved throwable
  # object" that may be provided at construction time and accessed via
  # the {@link #getException()} method is now known as the <i>cause</i>,
  # and may be accessed via the {@link Throwable#getCause()} method, as well
  # as the aforementioned "legacy method."
