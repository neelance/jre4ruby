    # A Reference instance is in one of four possible internal states:
    # 
    #     Active: Subject to special treatment by the garbage collector.  Some
    #     time after the collector detects that the reachability of the
    #     referent has changed to the appropriate state, it changes the
    #     instance's state to either Pending or Inactive, depending upon
    #     whether or not the instance was registered with a queue when it was
    #     created.  In the former case it also adds the instance to the
    #     pending-Reference list.  Newly-created instances are Active.
    # 
    #     Pending: An element of the pending-Reference list, waiting to be
    #     enqueued by the Reference-handler thread.  Unregistered instances
    #     are never in this state.
    # 
    #     Enqueued: An element of the queue with which the instance was
    #     registered when it was created.  When an instance is removed from
    #     its ReferenceQueue, it is made Inactive.  Unregistered instances are
    #     never in this state.
    # 
    #     Inactive: Nothing more to do.  Once an instance becomes Inactive its
    #     state will never change again.
    # 
    # The state is encoded in the queue and next fields as follows:
    # 
    #     Active: queue = ReferenceQueue with which instance is registered, or
    #     ReferenceQueue.NULL if it was not registered with a queue; next =
    #     null.
    # 
    #     Pending: queue = ReferenceQueue with which instance is registered;
    #     next = Following instance in queue, or this if at end of list.
    # 
    #     Enqueued: queue = ReferenceQueue.ENQUEUED; next = Following instance
    #     in queue, or this if at end of list.
    # 
    #     Inactive: queue = ReferenceQueue.NULL; next = this.
    # 
    # With this scheme the collector need only examine the next field in order
    # to determine whether a Reference instance requires special treatment: If
    # the next field is null then the instance is active; if it is non-null,
    # then the collector should treat the instance normally.
    # 
    # To ensure that concurrent collector can discover active Reference
    # objects without interfering with application threads that may apply
    # the enqueue() method to those objects, collectors should link
    # discovered objects through the discovered field.
