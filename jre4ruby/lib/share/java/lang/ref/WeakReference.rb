  # Weak reference objects, which do not prevent their referents from being
  # made finalizable, finalized, and then reclaimed.  Weak references are most
  # often used to implement canonicalizing mappings.
  # 
  # <p> Suppose that the garbage collector determines at a certain point in time
  # that an object is <a href="package-summary.html#reachability">weakly
  # reachable</a>.  At that time it will atomically clear all weak references to
  # that object and all weak references to any other weakly-reachable objects
  # from which that object is reachable through a chain of strong and soft
  # references.  At the same time it will declare all of the formerly
  # weakly-reachable objects to be finalizable.  At the same time or at some
  # later time it will enqueue those newly-cleared weak references that are
  # registered with reference queues.
