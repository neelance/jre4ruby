  # "LOCALE_LIST" will be replaced at built time by a list of locales we
  # defined in Defs.gmk. We want to exclude these locales from search to
  # gain better performance. For example, since we know if the resource
  # is built with Resources.gmk, they are not going to provide basename_en.class
  # & basename_en_US.class resources, in that case, continuing searching them
  # is expensive. By excluding them from the candidate locale list, these
  # resources won't be searched.
