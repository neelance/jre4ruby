  # Default break-iterator rules.  These rules are more or less general for
  # all locales, although there are probably a few we're missing.  The
  # behavior currently mimics the behavior of BreakIterator in JDK 1.2.
  # There are known deficiencies in this behavior, including the fact that
  # the logic for handling CJK characters works for Japanese but not for
  # Chinese, and that we don't currently have an appropriate locale for
  # Thai.  The resources will eventually be updated to fix these problems.
  # 
  # Modified for Hindi 3/1/99.
  # 
  # Since JDK 1.5.0, this file no longer goes to runtime and is used at J2SE
  # build phase in order to create [Character|Word|Line|Sentence]BreakIteratorData
  # files which are used on runtime instead.
