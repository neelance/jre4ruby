  # A Timer object is used by algorithms that require timed events.
  # For example, in an animation loop, a timer would help in
  # determining when to change frames.
  # 
  # A timer has an interval which determines when it "ticks";
  # that is, a timer delays for the specified interval and then
  # it calls the owner's tick() method.
  # 
  # Here's an example of creating a timer with a 5 sec interval:
  # 
  # <pre>
  # class Main implements Timeable {
  # public void tick(Timer timer) {
  # System.out.println("tick");
  # }
  # public static void main(String args[]) {
  # (new Timer(this, 5000)).cont();
  # }
  # }
  # </pre>
  # 
  # A timer can be stopped, continued, or reset at any time.
  # A timer's state is not stopped while it's calling the
  # owner's tick() method.
  # 
  # A timer can be regular or irregular.  If in regular mode,
  # a timer ticks at the specified interval, regardless of
  # how long the owner's tick() method takes.  While the timer
  # is running, no ticks are ever discarded.  That means that if
  # the owner's tick() method takes longer than the interval,
  # the ticks that would have occurred are delivered immediately.
  # 
  # In irregular mode, a timer starts delaying for exactly
  # the specified interval only after the tick() method returns.
  # 
  # Synchronization issues: do not hold the timer's monitor
  # while calling any of the Timer operations below otherwise
  # the Timer class will deadlock.

  # 
  # 
  # Synchronization issues:  there are two data structures that
  # require locking.  A Timer object and the Timer queue
  # (described in the TimerThread class).  To avoid deadlock,
  # the timer queue monitor is always acquired before the timer
  # object's monitor.  However, the timer queue monitor is acquired
  # only if the timer operation will make use of the timer
  # queue, e.g. stop().
  # 
  # The class monitor on the class TimerThread severs as the monitor
  # to the timer queue.
  # 
  # Possible feature: perhaps a timer should have an associated
  # thread priority.  The thread that makes the callback temporarily
  # takes on that priority before calling the owner's tick() method.
