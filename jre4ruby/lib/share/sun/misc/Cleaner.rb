  # General-purpose phantom-reference-based cleaners.
  # 
  # <p> Cleaners are a lightweight and more robust alternative to finalization.
  # They are lightweight because they are not created by the VM and thus do not
  # require a JNI upcall to be created, and because their cleanup code is
  # invoked directly by the reference-handler thread rather than by the
  # finalizer thread.  They are more robust because they use phantom references,
  # the weakest type of reference object, thereby avoiding the nasty ordering
  # problems inherent to finalization.
  # 
  # <p> A cleaner tracks a referent object and encapsulates a thunk of arbitrary
  # cleanup code.  Some time after the GC detects that a cleaner's referent has
  # become phantom-reachable, the reference-handler thread will run the cleaner.
  # Cleaners may also be invoked directly; they are thread safe and ensure that
  # they run their thunks at most once.
  # 
  # <p> Cleaners are not a replacement for finalization.  They should be used
  # only when the cleanup code is extremely simple and straightforward.
  # Nontrivial cleaners are inadvisable since they risk blocking the
  # reference-handler thread and delaying further cleanup and finalization.
