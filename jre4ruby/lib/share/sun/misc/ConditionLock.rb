  # ConditionLock is a Lock with a built in state variable.  This class
  # provides the ability to wait for the state variable to be set to a
  # desired value and then acquire the lock.<p>
  # 
  # The lockWhen() and unlockWith() methods can be safely intermixed
  # with the lock() and unlock() methods. However if there is a thread
  # waiting for the state variable to become a particular value and you
  # simply call Unlock(), that thread will not be able to acquire the
  # lock until the state variable equals its desired value. <p>
