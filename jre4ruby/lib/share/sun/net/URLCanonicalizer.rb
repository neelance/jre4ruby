  # Helper class to map URL "abbreviations" to real URLs.
  # The default implementation supports the following mappings:
  # ftp.mumble.bar/... => ftp://ftp.mumble.bar/...
  # gopher.mumble.bar/... => gopher://gopher.mumble.bar/...
  # other.name.dom/... => http://other.name.dom/...
  # /foo/... => file:/foo/...
  # 
  # Full URLs (those including a protocol name) are passed through unchanged.
  # 
  # Subclassers can override or extend this behavior to support different
  # or additional canonicalization policies.
