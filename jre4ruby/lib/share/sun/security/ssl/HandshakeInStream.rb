  # InputStream for handshake data, used internally only. Contains the
  # handshake message buffer and methods to parse them.
  # 
  # Once a new handshake record arrives, it is buffered in this class until
  # processed by the Handshaker. The buffer may also contain incomplete
  # handshake messages in case the message is split across multiple records.
  # Handshaker.process_record deals with all that. It may also contain
  # handshake messages larger than the default buffer size (e.g. large
  # certificate messages). The buffer is grown dynamically to handle that
  # (see InputRecord.queueHandshake()).
  # 
  # Note that the InputRecord used as a buffer here is separate from the
  # AppInStream.r, which is where data from the socket is initially read
  # into. This is because once the initial handshake has been completed,
  # handshake and application data messages may be interleaved arbitrarily
  # and must be processed independently.
