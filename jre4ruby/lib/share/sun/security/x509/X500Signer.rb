  # is needed in many public key signing applications.
  # 
  # <P>The name of the signer is important, both because knowing it is the
  # whole point of the signature, and because the associated X.509 certificate
  # is always used to verify the signature.
  # 
  # <P><em>The X.509 certificate chain is temporarily not associated with
  # the signer, but this omission will be resolved.</em>
