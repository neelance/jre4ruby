  # Represents the Delta CRL Indicator Extension.
  # 
  # <p>
  # The extension identifies a CRL as being a delta CRL.
  # Delta CRLs contain updates to revocation information previously distributed,
  # rather than all the information that would appear in a complete CRL.
  # The extension contains a CRL number that identifies the CRL, complete for a
  # given scope, that was used as the starting point in the generation of
  # this delta CRL.
  # 
  # <p>
  # The extension is defined in Section 5.2.4 of
  # <a href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3280.txt">Internet X.509 PKI Certific
  # ate and Certificate Revocation List (CRL) Profile</a>.
  # 
  # <p>
  # Its ASN.1 definition is as follows:
  # <pre>
  # id-ce-deltaCRLIndicator OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { id-ce 27 }
  # 
  # BaseCRLNumber ::= CRLNumber
  # CRLNumber ::= INTEGER (0..MAX)
  # </pre>
